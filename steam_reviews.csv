Rust,252490,177409644,Rust is a great game. It is like real life if there where no rules. Everyone is very toxic if they have power but when they are starting they are crybabies. I think that its a pretty hard game to master and needs a lot of hours which most people dont have. Before playing you need to know that everything is temporary so you wont be frustrated with the game. This game is not for everyone. The game is great in its own unique way and also is perfect if you are trying to become an electrician.
Rust,252490,177619447,"This game makes me want to kill myself. It's so addicting I low key cant hop off the game even when I try. I can literally play for 10+ hours at a time if I felt like it easily. Please do NOT get this fucking game. It is full of Nazis, Russians, racism and loud little kids screaming at you for your 14 wood you just farmed. You can't get a fucking base down because of full ak kits roaming for no fucking reason. If you ever think of getting this game, I ADVISE YOU TO NOT GET IT, I REPEAT, DO NOT GET THIS GAME."
Rust,252490,178793028,"Great game very unique and grindy, which I personally enjoy. It's always been my #1 game, and I've been playing since the Legacy days. It's come a long way, i definitely recommend it, but just keep in mind that there's a lot to learn and figure out, so it can be frustrating for new players at first."
Rust,252490,177844978,"[h1]My [i]Rust[/i] Review - 223 Hours In[/h1]

[b]Rating:[/b] ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)

223 hours in Rust has taught me one thing: you either survive and thrive, or you get ambushed naked and lose everything. This game is ruthless, and honestly, that’s half the fun. Here’s my take from a player who’s crafted, built, fought, and gotten betrayed way too many times.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Gameplay - Brutal, Unpredictable, and Completely Addictive[/h2]
In Rust, you’re constantly on your toes. You start with nothing but a rock and a torch, scavenging for resources, crafting, and upgrading your base… all while everyone else is trying to take you out. The satisfaction of going from a naked survivor to a geared warrior with a fully fortified base is a journey that’s tough but incredibly rewarding.

Some classic Rust experiences:

Sneaking into someone’s base and “borrowing” supplies.
Logging off after a good session… only to come back and find you’ve been raided.
Making allies with strangers, who may turn on you at any moment!
[hr][/hr]

[h2]Graphics & Environment - Gritty and Real[/h2]
The environment is unforgiving but beautifully rendered. From dense forests to wide-open plains, the scenery is as stunning as it is hostile. Watching the sun rise as you’re perched on top of a homemade fortress just feels epic… until the gunshots start.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Community - Friend or Foe?[/h2]
The Rust community has taught me not to trust anyone. While you’ll occasionally find some truly awesome teammates, more often than not, people are just out for your loot. The constant paranoia and “who can I trust?” feeling really adds to the tension and makes every encounter memorable.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Final Thoughts - Love It or Hate It, It’s a Blast[/h2]
Rust is one of those games where you’re either addicted or totally over it. For me, the challenge, the highs and lows, and the pure unpredictability keep me coming back. Sure, it can be frustrating (and heartbreaking) when you lose everything, but that’s all part of the survival experience. If you’re up for a ruthless, intense, and rewarding game, Rust is worth every hour.

[b]Recommended[/b] for anyone who enjoys survival games with a side of betrayal.

Rust,252490,178578421,"Great fun, very addictive and highly toxic... prepare to loose hours of your life on this game."
Rust,252490,177383935,"game is horrible. toxic community and the support is horrible. my account was hacked and the hackers cheated on various servers and it resulted in a perm ban on my account, not even a warning a straight up game ban, i contacted support multiple times only to be met with the equivalent of a ""go fck your self bud"" saying that its my responsiblity, like apologies im not changing my steam password every week. spent 90+ dollars on this game including dlcs and skins only to be met with heartless devs and shitty support. do not buy"
Rust,252490,177862501,fucking ass. wont let me in the game because its too fucking hard to load. It crashes all the time. The only playtime i have is waiting for 3 hours to get in the game. And i didn't even get to play because after 3 hours it crashed again.
Rust,252490,178818993,"This game has ruined my life. Every aspect of it is completely and utterly terrible. I lose sleep pull multiple all nighters in a row and it is all I think about. To add to this the community has to be the worst community out of any other games. If you are looking for a game that you want the n word screamed at you 100 times in a row then rust is for you. Do not buy or download this game if you want to keep your sanity, There isnt a single normal person on here and you will probably get cyber molested."
Rust,252490,177563743,its the most unfair game and company i have ever seen support team is just a bot banning innocent people got hacked from hackers and they say its not our problem that you got hacked and they leave the real hackers alive and just hack more innocent accounts and they ban more innocent account and leave hacker alive
Rust,252490,178578300,"New update is literally survive the wolves simulator, i have seen and died to more wolves than players in the first 40 minutes of the wipe and im loosing my mind."
Rust,252490,177092042,"It could be a nice game, but there are way too many gun slingers around doing nothing but kill people even on softcore servers. the whole gathering and building experience is totally f*cked because of those morr0ns. If you want yet another senseless a shoot and kill game, go ahead. Otherwise just don't waste time and money on that game"
Rust,252490,178129411,"the game itself isn'tall that bad but is more the player. There is only 4 options either a nerd that has 10,000k hours and no life and while kill you and not miss a shot
A hackerthat will fly in your base and take all your loot
a racist thats will sit outside you door for 5-10 hours and will do anything to piss you off
or just a casual that wants to play and have fun (very rare)"
Rust,252490,177832887,"83 hours in and its loss after loss  haha i love this game! i like the challenges and the rush of trying to loot and farm anything and everything, cant wait untili get better at pvp"
Rust,252490,178585837,"Best piano game you can play, My 150 hours well spent performing music to fellow survivors.
You can plug in your midi piano and fire away.
I wish more games would replicate the piano system in this game."
Rust,252490,178666147,The nakeds are scary and racist they hurt my feelings. They dont get banned and i dont like being called the n word. Its a bad word and really racist. Then theres the full metal kids that think there good but die to a bow. The nakeds that call people the N word need to get a temporary ban. Its really bad to say the N word and i really dont like people that say the n word it makes me mad because im black. Most people that say the n word are white or a diffrent race that is not black. Why is there so many people that say the n word in this game i dont like it so they should get a temp ban. Please temp ban people that are racist. Only on modded servers they sometimes get banned. Please make that a feature to the game please and thanks you. :)
Rust,252490,178858692,"its like fent. Its so good on the highs, kills u on the lows."
Rust,252490,178699350,Been playing  Rust for years on console and now on PC.  The mix of constant threat of other players with a dynamic world make the game addicting and fun.  Constant updates make the game always fresh.
Rust,252490,178856316,"Worst anti-cheat ever, too many gimmicky items when they should be working on optimization. ALSO the wolf AI update has got to be the dumbest shit I've ever seen."
Rust,252490,178779023,"This game opted out of family sharing, which is cringe. 

Do not allow publishers to claim purchasing is not owning, sharing amongst your games like discs among family should be encouraged not dissuaded."
Rust,252490,177638873,"I have nearly 7k Hours. Had a lot of fun and Kicks! But atm the state of the game is terrible because every single sever is full with cheaters. Anticheat is just not working. And in a game where u spend days for the final push on your enemies and a cheater comes and kills your whole team in seconds this is just frustrating. 

One of the best survival games out there but cheating is such a big problem that the game is currently unplaybale!
Change my mind Facepunch! Show me results!"

GTA V,271590,177058533,"New lovely thing happening where battleye constantly requires an update and kicks me out of GTA ONLINE after I complete a job. I uninstalled the rockstar launcher and reinstalled. Everything seemed fine, helped someone with their setup and when it was done I got an error and was then told battle eye needed an update...

BULL.......S...........H..........1........T! No reason for battle eye to need an update when it would have been the most previous update after installing. Seems like every time I have momentum in this game it crashes for some unknown reason..... I have a great computer with a fresh install of windows on a brand new SSD. These developers need to get their shit together or im just gonna be one of the many people who dont pre order or buy GTA 6. Developers, you have our trust, DONT LOSE IT"
GTA V,271590,177506642,"As much fun as I’ve had with grand theft auto, I can no longer recommend anything that shit star does.

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

"
GTA V,271590,178479891,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."
GTA V,271590,178430120,"Battleye ruined the game. makes online unplayable because it makes you restart for an ""update"" that doesnt exist. it also makes it so that all linux users that have been playing the game for ten years with no issue suddenly cant. garbage"
GTA V,271590,177816947,"Game is fantastic, but I can't recommend until they fix two major issues. I do not want to install your trash launcher or your trash anit cheat. We all know Rockstar lets hackers run wild and bans good players. I just want to play single player offline and I still can't without installing all this invasive garbage? What a bunch of ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
GTA V,271590,178414435,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
GTA V,271590,177152642,"Unbelievable unbalanced , too grindy , unclear and confusing ui , next to nothing controller support , pay to win cards , no tutorials , same mission copy and pasted like a 100 times , no explanation on anything , unfun and most of the time boring gameplay, way to long loading screens , incredibly stupid ai.
3/10"
GTA V,271590,178194910,"Game is immmersive and fun but only if you play in private invite only session with friends,avoid public sessions;they are full of cheaters and griefers,story mode is also good but not as much as online"
GTA V,271590,178136423,After working for so long. Rockstar and their great wisdom decided to kill linux support. I am assuming windows is going around paying off these companies to try and kill valve and linux. I guess rockstar just wont be getting anymore of my money.
GTA V,271590,177778367,"Single player is excellent. Online is predatory, grindy but fun.

They broke online on Linux with their new anti-cheat. I cant play the game anymore. That's Bad. Literally unplayable. 0 / 5."
GTA V,271590,178800112,"Great game while it lasted. Ruined forever by modders who see you as their play-thing.
Do I want to be teleported somewhere against my will, and griefed by another bored player? No thank you. I'll just consider the online game dead, and never play it again instead. 0/10 at this point. 
Peer networking will never work. How about re-investing some of that Shark Card money into some servers? No?"
GTA V,271590,177301310,"Played 60 hours. Log in one day and get an infinite loading bug. Google solutions and apparently it's pretty common.
Spend 10 hours trying to fix, verified game files + full reinstall + deleted all saves + deleted all settings. No fix.

Played 60 hours and now game just doesn't start overnight. How can this be possible in 2024? Insane."
GTA V,271590,177125456,"I have played GTA V for thousands of hours on three consoles, with my seam deck being the final console I play it on. In the final year of the game's life, they implement an anticheat which completely locks out Linux/Steam Deck players from playing online anymore. Clearly done to show investors that GTA 6 online will be stable, at the expense of their fans. If I play GTA 6, it will be pirated"
GTA V,271590,177738848,"This was a very fun game, up until I was unfairly banned for what they assumed I was cheating.
I had bought shark cards to get money legit and their anti-cheat is too sensitive.
This game takes too long to load, it lags a lot, too many cheaters, white screen error freezes you out, etc.
Goodluck Rockstar."
GTA V,271590,177627465,"GTA 5 want down hill real fucking quick with the new update, because of the new anti-cheat system no more Linux users and no more travelling with your steam deck ( I know they both run on Linux), please remove the anti-cheat and flying vehicles okay so we can make the game fun and playable again.

the devs do make same terrible decisions to this game"
GTA V,271590,177002797,"I wouldn't recommend this since I play on my Steam Deck 98% of the time, and Steam & Rockstar can't seem to work things out so I can continue playing.  Totally suks to have been able to play a game for over 400 hours, only to have it stop functioning because of an Anti-Cheat that works on other Steam/Linux games on the Deck..."
GTA V,271590,178431203,"Rockstar and Battleye have butchered this once pristine title. Frame rates have dropped on my RTX3070 to around 60fps on ultra 1080p now when I used to play at 4k ultra @ 70fps. This is due to the new Battleye implementation and furthermore the online game is now completely unplayable due to the same Blackeye. Don't forget the R* Launcher, what a lovely piece of software.."
GTA V,271590,177574391,"Great, it's become completely unplayable since the introduction of BattlEye Anticheat. Ran at 80-100 fps before, now struggles to maintain 30. The modders, who are the reason BattlEye was implemented in the first place, still run rampant. It is a mystery to me how a company can so reliably make one horrible decision after another and still be in business."
Black Ops 6 Campaign,2933620,177722122,"YOU ARE NOT PURCHASING A GAME, BUT A DLC FOR THE CALL OF DUTY LAUNCHER, and your Steam playtime will be shared by any other CoD game that uses this launcher. If you have more than 2 hours cumulative in any CoD, you will be unable to refund the game without opening a Steam support ticket, which is not a guaranteed refund. This is a clear attempt to circumvent Steam's refund policies."
Black Ops 6 Campaign,2933620,177737814,"zombies = very fun, well designed maps
multiplayer = rage inducing, as always

only thing i'd change is get rid of COD HQ and let me launch BO6 from my desktop"
Black Ops 6 Campaign,2933620,177683088,The zombies mode has only 2 maps and they still felt longer than the whole MW3 campaign.
Black Ops 6 Campaign,2933620,177981927,Most fun I've had in awhile on a call of duty. Only complaint is the coddling to the sensitive community.  Why can't we talk to enemy team after a match or when switching sides on search and destroy. Our operators can swear but if we do we get com banned? It's an M rated game. Quit making it so soft.
Black Ops 6 Campaign,2933620,177697397,"dear COD or whoever, please could you separate the cods into there own game and get rid of the all new cods in one launcher please. I'm sick and tired of constantly deleting changing modding files, I don't want to have to install war-zone just to play zombies on black ops 6. Why isn't it just it's own game why do you constantly put all cods under the one launcher and then having to search and look through the menus, to try and find the cod you want to play. I want to play cod not search through what looks to be a Netflix page, full of purchase options to find the thing I want...... I even thought after buying Black ops 6, steam had broke because I spent a good five minutes searching for black ops 6 in my library only to find out oh no its just a DLC. so why you paying full game price for what seems to just be a DLC or at least steam is saying its a DLC."
Black Ops 6 Campaign,2933620,177688923,"[h1] It's ridiculous [/h1]

Right now in order to launch Black Ops 6 -> I am opening Steam, then clicking on the general Call Of Duty game that I have in my library. Waiting for it to load 5 minutes, after asking me to restart it multiple times for some ""much needed upgrades"", then when I'm done with this I navigate through the launcher to find Black Ops 6. I click on the game and it asks me which version do I want to play Campaign or Multiplayer. After I click one of the versions the first launcher closes, then the actual Black Ops 6 starts. After asking me to restart multiple times for some much needed updates, I am in and ready to play the mode that I chose (Campaign or Multiplayer). If I want to switch modes I need to exit the game, open the first launcher, choose the different mode, close the first launcher and launch the Black Ops 6 mode that I chose.|

Activision what are you smoking? Do you think that this is a good experience for the player? 

Remove Call Of Duty HQ..."
Black Ops 6 Campaign,2933620,177683891,Ahhh finally game is updating simulator has been released. Also why tf do they not have a separate launcher for cod bo6.

I have never had problems playing multiplayer games before, but the rubberbanding and lag even on solo modes is actually unplayable on my 50mb internet. I decided to refund this game about a hour in. If you have slow internet, I do not recommend buying this game whatsoever. Even the campaign lags because it runs off a server and requires texture streaming!!! Absolutely insane. 0/10"
Black Ops 6 Campaign,2933620,177896959,"I usually only write Campaign reviews for my Call of Duty games but I feel compelled to be 100% honest about Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6. I have played every single CoD game to date, to 100% completion - Xbox, PC and PS. I have played each zombies map and completed all Easter eggs to date also. The only CoD game I have ""passed"" on is Vanguard (and for good reason).

Below I will write a little about the zombies, multiplayer and campaign but first a quick disclaimer!

[b] This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on. [/b] 

[h1][b] Multiplayer - All in one [/b][/h1] 
The BAD aspects of MP:
⚫The Multiplayer is no different from other CoD games. It's the same copy and pasted Multiplayer with ""omni movement"" thrown in. At no point do you actually see anyone use this mechanic but the ""strafe run backwards, forwards, sideways""... that's it. It gets in your way more than what you would like to admit, trust me. Yeah you see people ""dolphin dive"" but that's been a thing since BO1...
⚫Then you have the maps. The maps are so stupidly small and unbalanced. You can be spawn killed by the same guy over and over again because the spawns are horrendous. Worse actually than MW3 and MW2... heck... Cold War had better spawns and maps than this game.
⚫The UI is still stupidly clunky and has a menu for a menu for a menu. They have not listened to feedback about this in the slightest.
⚫I could swear that the emblems and calling cards are all AI generated... if this is true why? Why not use older calling cards and emblems from previous Black Ops games? Cold War done this right. Was this a budget thing or do you not care about REAL artists and instead rely on AI garbage.
⚫Yet another CoD that, using any non levelled weapon - you will be killed by someone using attachments on theirs. I hate how CoD has become ""Attachments matter"" on every single gun. It is NOT innovative at all. A ""NEW"" player compared to a level 55 will get shredded and this drives players away.

Good part about MP:
⚫Remember the good ol' prestige system? Well guess what? That is back and it even comes with rewards!! 

[h1][b] Zombie's - All in one [/b][/h1] 
The good aspects of Zombies:
⚫Zombies makes it's triumphant return with ROUND BASED zombies. We have all been CRAVING this for a long time and finally, it has returned. (compared o that DMZ/Warzone zombies mode that was horrendous)
⚫Gobblegums from BO3 return and I have to say, this is a welcome back addition because some of these gobblegums are insanely fun to use. My favourite lets you teleport ANYWHERE on the map (1 time use). Also, a bonus - you can carry up to 3 Gobblegums now!!! 
⚫The maps - Liberty Falls and Terminus are fun to run around on. For example - Terminus is a prison island map when you can actually go around in a boat to tiny other islands scattered around, OH, and a WARNING - BEWARE THE WATER!!! Then you have Liberty Falls which is like a little town filled with shops you can open up and a church that takes you into ""another dimension?"" 
⚫Apart from a weird story, the gameplay feels SOLID in zombies. Smooth and very rewarding. I loved the feeling of the omni movement in zombies... having this much control of my movement while ""critical killing"" zombies just felt.... AMAZING!!

The BAD aspects of Zombies:
⚫PHD Flopper has made a return also... but sadly.. it is a terrible perk. Compare it to BO2 PHD Flopper, this version of it really, REALLY sucks.
⚫The zombies scale way to quickly and makes ""having fun"" just not accomplish-able because you are forced to upgrade your weapons way to quickly leading to you stressing about ""progressing"" your weapons. Zombies just scale in health tenfold and if you are using a ""non upgraded/non pack-a-punched"" gun you will feel this hit you hard.
⚫The spawns for the Mangler/Elite zombie are way to often leading to heavily bloat and they just become bullet sponges. Then it spawns abominations constantly which also leads to heavy bullet sponge bloated enemies.
⚫The story is basically non-existent. I just don't know where the story is going to go but it just feels... off. It's like - you play casually without a single hint on what to do and then all of a sudden you get some dialogue? what?

[h1][b] Campaign - All in one [/b][/h1] 
The Good aspects of the Campaign:
⚫The Campaign, honestly, is actually pretty good. I would say it has been better than the last 3/4 CoD campaigns by a good bit. (not going to spoil it, sorry!)
⚫Each mission can be approached in several ways, either stealth or loud, or you can become a super spy! Well, not 007 but the espionage that you CAN pull off makes you feel absolutely slick!!
⚫The missions you play are very well put together compared to other CoD games also. What I mean by this is - it takes you back to CoD roots, classic WAR roots (the gulf mission) and then you get the more modern missions that are rather ""to-scale"".
⚫You know Modern Warfare's ""open world"" missions? Well, BO6 blows those out of the water and does it so much better than MW3 did.
⚫The characters are really well designed. Addler to be more exact. I love him for some reason and the backstories you learn about them is just perfectly implemented.

The BAD aspects of the Campaign:
⚫Again, another ""CoD"" campaign that is to scared to use ""real world"" issues, politics e.t.c (such as chemical weapons, terrorism, torture e.t.c) in it's missions ""MORE"", IT IS A WAR AFTER ALL (an it's got REAL political people in it) and these people don't just torture 1 person and move on or blow up one building and move on e.t.c. Can't keep politics out of a game like this, so why not embrace it? It's a game.

[h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1] 
All in all, after my opinion has been jotted down - Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6 feels like an underwhelming, overhyped, next-generation CoD game. The zombies are fun, slightly needs some work, campaign is good but a copy and pasted MP that is stupidly broken... AGAIN might I add... this shows that Treyarch, Activision e.t.c do not listen to us, they do not care about their ""TARGET AUDIENCE""... they only care about this NEW ""Audience"" that want ""cat ear skins, glowing anime skins, moaning gun skins"" e.t.c... when did CoD become less ""MILSIM"" and more.... ugh.

I waited a long time for a NEW Black Ops game and I feel like I have been forgotten about and replaced by this new generation. I cannot recommend a OVERPRICED copy and paste fest game that will just be released AGAIN a year from now with a new title, some extra paid pronouns, some new gender anime skin packs and an extra £20 for ""BETTER AUDIO"".

Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6 is NOT worth £99.99 or even £69.99. No wonder its on Game pass day 1. Its utter garbage.

[h1][b] 5/10. Zombies is good and so is Campaign but MP is unbalanced as hell right now. Overpriced also. [/b][/h1]"

Black Ops 6 Campaign,2933620,177971882,"Growing up, Call of Duty wasn’t just a game for me—it was a defining part of my childhood. The thrill of sneaking around corners, clutching matches with my mates, and feeling the immersion that games like Modern Warfare and the original Black Ops offered. It was more than just a shooter; it was an experience that shaped my love for gaming.

Fast forward to Black Ops 6, and it feels like that magic has been replaced by a relentless cash grab. Every year, the developers slap together what’s essentially the same game, repackaged and slightly reskinned with a few new operators and recycled maps. The content feels recycled, the gameplay stagnates, and the passion from developers—if it’s there—seems buried under layers of microtransactions. It’s like they’ve traded heart and innovation for quick cash, exploiting the same fanbase that built the franchise.

Honestly, it’s tough to watch a series that once had me hooked become a shell of what it was. I can’t help but hope they’re held accountable for these choices. Maybe a decline in their sales will be the wake-up call they need, and Call of Duty might one day get back to being the legendary franchise we loved. Until then, I’m sitting this one out and hoping they remember why players loved the game in the first place."
Black Ops 6 Campaign,2933620,177862063,"Very disappointing. It's always a gamble buying the new Call of Duty. Been burned before, burned once again (looking at you, Vanguard).

Another entry plagued by the same issues, issues a multi-billion dollar corporation can't seem to iron out. Load the game? Welcome to our useless launcher where we show you an ad for the game you're already trying to play. New update? Update requires restart. Now restart again. No, you have to restart via the launcher. Okay, now shaders need to redownload. Oh and also now you can't change to DLSS. Win a game? Play 3 more against teams of the best players we could find. Want to win a gunfight? Too bad, have some packet burst.

They clearly don't care, just keep buying skins.
"
Black Ops 6 Campaign,2933620,178015535,"really wish there was a mid option for this game. While the movement is smooth, the guns feel great, and the game runs just fine. 

The maps are terrible. I'd say about 40% of them are good. They also really need to fix the spawning its insane the amount of times I spawn in next to an enemy player ""SPAWN DIE, SPAWN DIE, SPAWN DIE!"". Also, they really need to fix the matchmaking. If I do well one round the next I'm playing against people who haven't touched grass all summer. 

The campaign seems decent so far but I have not completed it, but from what i have played its decent....Not great but decent."
Black Ops 6 Campaign,2933620,177803877,"Honest take

Games empty.

The game doesn't feel different, it feels like you're playing a game that wipes every season like tarkov except their seasons cost 60-100 bucks.

You keep no skins, no purchases.

They didn't keep any of the modes from prior titles like Ground War or Invasion. It's just the normal 6v6 multiplayer modes.

They only have a handful of guns for each type. I think everyone has unanimously agreed the maps are badly designed.

The campaign is alright but it's a cod story so it's predictable.

My advice to Activision? If you want to make a live service model game, make one. This is just pumping video game addicts for cash and it's immoral.

To the players that can't help themselves, seek help, don't buy this trash. Spend the 70 on a therapy session, start a family, do something productive because this is just embarassing supporting this company.

I have no idea how this is even at 60%. It needs to be at 30%."
Black Ops 6 Campaign,2933620,178501551,"game is fun, but the company is predatory and really doesnt care about its playerbase. theyre just trying to sell product to a gullible audience (me). the first thing you see when you open the central app (also predatory business tactic) is 3 buttons, the largest of which is just an add to buy the $30 cosmetic pack. 

please dont buy this game"
Black Ops 6 Campaign,2933620,177688802,"the game won't launch on Steam. Clicking the ""Play"" button does nothing and I've pressed that button over 20 times. No error code, no reaction, no program startup. ""Play"" button just reappears on Steam launch page."
Black Ops 6 Campaign,2933620,178537070,"[b]The good:[/b] 
I originally thought that Omnimovement was going to be an absolute nightmare of a system to play against, with people abusing it to play the game like it's the Matrix... but it's actually a really nice intuitive system that could use some tweaks that I would like to see adopted as somewhat of an FPS standard with some tweaks (stamina, or take damage if you hit stairs, ETC).

[b]The BAD: [/b]
[list]
    [*]Gunplay is the worst it has been in a COD I've ever played. Headshots don't matter because most guns take the same number of bullets to kill to head or body.
    [*]Turns out some guns (like the AK) only do 15% more damage with headshots, what the actual hell?
    [*]Hit Registration doesn't make sense. Get 10 hit markers with an XM4 at 20 meters and still die.
    [*]No Ground War/Large Map game modes that let you run around and approach fights from a variety of angles.
    [*]Nothing like staring at 1 minute of ""BEST PLAY""/""Watch 3 people emote at the screen"" at the end of a round instead of starting the next.
[/list] 

I seriously regret buying this, wish I could refund, but the issues took more time to recognize."
Black Ops 6 Campaign,2933620,177815394,"Always online and always a buggy mess, only in this game does my internet drop consistently through campaign missions, causing me to go through the 80 submenus and loading screens just to be able to get back to where I was, or restart the mission because it's a coinflip on if your progress actually saved or not.

You'd think after making the same game for the last 5 years they'd iron out the bugs."
Black Ops 6 Campaign,2933620,178017527,"Campaign is pretty good and zombies is like Cold War with Classic features mixed in. Pretty fun but the base maps get a bit repetitive for long sessions. Hopefully the DLC will be good. Multiplayer is standard COD affair, I'd recommend a controller for that added aim assist with crossplay being default. I like that the multiplayer has been slimmed down like BO1 and BO2. No unnecessary bloat (at least yet). Definitely better than MWII and MWIII imo."
Black Ops 6 Campaign,2933620,178415222,"Firstly how can this game be 170 GB? i truly believe there's a secret folder full of Furry P. THERE IS NO WAY this game can take up that much space. And Whoever decided to add all games in the same launcher must either have the smallest brain or the biggest monster in their pants and decide to make us all suffer so he can watch down on all the people trying to download this game whilst tugging it dry. I just don't understand why i waited since 1981 to download this 180 GB game just to get an update after for 150 GB. I'm still waiting for the 70 DOLLAR game to download or should i say every other cod just because this guy with his pea brain decided to make all the games in the same launcher instead of making each one separate like every other game. i could've downloaded every 18+ Game and fully achieved each one with my monitor splattered in my ""milk"" before this game came close to a quarter downloaded.

It is a bit more slow paced than HON but oh my it is still much fun with great abilities and spells. Personaly I think LOL is a bit more balanced than HON because no matter what character you get you can become strong and powerfull, unlike HON where you have to be a carry to really get buffed in the late game.

To sum it up, if you love siege, let it go. Stop playing it. Let it die from hackers and hope they finally do something about it when the game literally only has hackers. Stop buying skins as well, they just make shittier and shittier elites, along with getting lazier about new content. The R6 we know and love is gone, so let it go, stop living in the past.

	EA SPORTS FC 25,2669320,177206267,"Last FIFA I played was... 13 i think.
Gameplay wise it is similar. Players move better, however sometimes when I do a through pass, the player just stops running which is irritating.
Also defensive play can be weird (might be just me doing something wrong). Sometimes when I run with the ball and enemy wants to tackle me, they can teleport in order to get in the right distance. While when opponent runs with the ball and I tackle them, literally nothing happens, not even animation of the player being pushed. I'm treated as a weak gust of wind.
Other than that, I mainly play Ultimate team. You earn very little in-game money. When I watched some streamers (previous FIFAs though) spend thousands $, open dozens of packs and get nothing worth it... yeah, building team is hard.

Bug wise... gameplay seems fine, except the tackle thing. However I often get menu bugs - when switching tabs or after finish a match, the menus just don't load. I have background screen, music plays, I can open and close social menu, but nothing else.
When you start the game, the FC 25 logo is so pixelated that it's actually kinda sad. 360p image upscaled to 1440p resolution.

Also alt F4 works really well and fast."

Granted all the other games had issues but it was tolerable. However, with the version of the game I would advise looking at UFL or Goals. The mechanics are clunky at best, the finishing is awful, passing is absolutely atrocious and the AI is just horrendous. The AI is probably the best defender in the game as it doesn't matter who you have the AI will be granted a speed boost, physicality boost and defensive boost but when attacking it seems to render itself inactive or possibly minimal use is more of an apt description due to the amount of times it moves players into an offside position when you are not asking for any runs to be made. The PC port is also extremely temperamental as it lags during games freezes causing you to forcefully close the game to restart it back up.

I genuinely do not expect people to read this but this was primarily to vent my frustration at this unfinished product which shows where EA are going with this game. Unless the game improves over the next release this series will more than likely die out especially with other companies making games. Unless there is a vast improvement to the mechanics especially the passing,shooting and tackling. I hope EA don't go and do their usual backwards thinking and decide to make this even worse then it is now. 

EA just get actual game developers that understand gamers as the ones you have now surely do not

	EA SPORTS FC 25,2669320,178172231,"Garbage game, Garbage mechanics, Retarded AIs, and just a money hungry remake of earlier games. Dont buy if you want to preserve your wealth and mental health."
	EA SPORTS FC 25,2669320,178115726,"As an avid fan of the franchise, it pains me to write this review for FC 25, which has delivered an immensely disappointing and frustrating experience. The most glaring issue is the abysmal gameplay balance, which feels more like a step backward than an improvement. Matches are too often decided by glaring AI inconsistencies, making even basic mechanics feel random and unreliable. It’s genuinely astonishing how unrefined the game feels after years of supposed advancements.

Moreover, it's hard to ignore the evident lack of regard from EA for the game's current state. Community feedback seems disregarded entirely, with players voicing frustrations about bugs, balancing issues, and broken mechanics that have yet to be addressed. While cosmetic updates and monetization strategies are regularly prioritized, essential gameplay fixes are blatantly neglected, leaving the core experience in a poor state.

In its current form, FC 25 feels less like a polished soccer simulation and more like a cash grab, relying on fans’ loyalty without showing any commitment to improving the player experience. For a company as established as EA, it’s disappointing to see the community treated with such disregard, and the product itself left in such a poor state."
	EA SPORTS FC 25,2669320,177800029,"fifa 15 controls better than fc 25. the passing is so slow and delayed. ive changed the passing settings and all the other settings and this game cant play how i want it to. the fact that fifa 15 plays faster and better than this shows where ea is focused on this series, and its not on how the game plays."
	EA SPORTS FC 25,2669320,178839939,"I can’t even comprehend how bad a video game can be, so here are my thoughts (mostly about Ultimate Team) as a pros/cons list.


CONS:
-Nontent every day; I can’t remember the last time they added a quality SBC that wasn’t either overpriced or just down right bad.
- ""Microtransactions"" - packs cost €15-25 each; with new packs added daily, I assume that's what they call “content.”
- There’s always at least one AFK player in rush games, since it’s the quickest way to complete evolutions. You can’t do anything about it, so you just carry on, struggling against tryhards on the opposing team. I wonder if they’ll ever add an option to kick AFK players.
- There was no option to mute the commentator in Rush mode until they finally added it in a recent patch.
- CPU defense is too strong. You’ll end up passing the ball around for 10-15 minutes, hoping your opponent will get impatient and rush their defender so you can finally score. The same issue exists in Squad Battles—sometimes, you’ll easily win on Legendary difficulty, while other times you’ll struggle to score and lose.
- ""Nonexistent"" DDA - Even if your opponent is down 0-5 at halftime, they still have a high chance of making a comeback. EA, of course, claims there’s no such thing as Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA).
- Player intelligence is poor; 80% of passes go off-target, so you end up losing possession. The defensive and attacking AI is lacking as well.
- The game demands a huge time commitment. For better rewards, you’ll need to play 44 games a week (12 in Division Rivals, 15 in FUT Champions, 12 in Squad Battles, and 5 qualifiers), each lasting around 10 minutes. That’s 7 hours a week, which isn’t terrible, but realistically you’d need to play 20-25 games to achieve 12 wins in Division Rivals. While the rewards are better, they’re still not worth the time, which seems intended to push players toward store packs.
- Many players do nothing but spam skill moves such as fake shots and roulettes, repeatedly losing possession. It’s repetitive and frustrating.
- Running to the edge of the field, cutting back, and scoring is easy because the goalkeeper’s AI doesn’t react well.
- The game crashes often after redeeming an SBC.
- After every game, there’s a popup showing objective completion—even when nothing was actually completed.
- Sometimes, the playstyle+ icon turns into large white triangles covering the screen, which requires you to restart the game for them to disappear.
- Inviting friends to a lobby is unreliable, as the overlay button frequently disappears, forcing you to restart the game.
- Draft  hasn’t been updated in eight years, and they haven’t even adjusted offline match length to match that with Squad Battles.
- Lack of highly advertised cosmetic evos.


PROS:
- You can create good-looking players in Clubs mode.
- Manager mode is relatively well-rounded and enjoyable.
- Roles+ and Roles++ 
- Most Ultimate Team modes have updated rewards


SUMMARY:
While the gameplay feels smoother than in FC24, the experience remains disappointing, especially with the push for microtransactions. Overall, I don’t recommend buying the game or spending money on packs."
	EA SPORTS FC 25,2669320,178715412,"I don't know how to say it but this is the most pathetic and completely disgusting game I have ever played. My initial thoughts on this before was maybe it's gonna be better than EA FC 24 but by the divine intervention of the gods themselves, EA has made it significantly worse in nearly every aspect. Why do I still have bugs from EA FC 24?? Just why?? Have you actually played your game??? Everything top to bottom is horrible apart from clubs(but that's only fun if you have people to play with, good luck if you're doing drop ins)

The community itself is a trainwreck too, 2 parts of it specifically: 1. The people who keep buying these FC points and allow this game and gameplay to be horrible. 2. Who keeps buying FC Points!???!?

Honestly don't know how these guys sit there and say they are proud of this game... Absolute delusion in it's finest.

In summary dear reader: Search up the meme ""Our Expectations Were Low But Holy F***"" and this game embodies that meme to a tee. Wouldn't let my worst enemy play this game. I'll only stick to clubs but this game is just disappointing."
	EA SPORTS FC 25,2669320,178198225,"Honestly, this is the worst game that I have ever played. Every match is literally the same. In first 20 minutes you know if you are going to win or lose the game. If the ball bounces at least 3 times around the box, you are going to concede the goal. Almost every match you are going to concede a goal in a stoppage time. There is no way to remove roles markers at the beginning of the game, so frustrating. Game is so scripted that is unplayable. Worst 60 euros spent in my life."
	EA SPORTS FC 25,2669320,177920281,"I barely post reviews, but since I just lost again due to the fact that the gameplay this year feels worse than stage 4 cancer on your genitals, I couldn't help but write this.

I've been playing FIFA/EA FC for over 10 years and this game feels like the worst one ever. Animations are absolute fucking dogshit, DDA/Scripting in FUT makes it impossible to win more than two games in a row and don't even get me started about the laziness of the developers making this piece of fucking garbage since they just copied and paste EA FC 24 with a different name and even worse fucking gameplay. Every game 10 new different fucking bugs appear out of nowhere and don't even think about EA fixing those bugs; they simply don't give a flying fuck.

I'd rather get hooked to fentanyl, divorce my wife, lose my job and live under a fucking bridge than to ever buy an EA game ever again, especially EA FC. 

Thanks for listening to my TedTalk."
	EA SPORTS FC 25,2669320,177617473,"This is by far the worst fifa game I have ever played. I've been playing since fifa 11. Arguably this might be the worst video game I have ever played in my life in any genre. Roblox has better soccer games than this shit. I am a division 3 and weekend league player in all previous fifas. I can not even make it out of division 6 and cannot qualify for the weekend at all. Before anyone says ""skill issue"" let me explain. The defenders in this game do not like to defend at all. I make a tackle and it falls straight to the attackers foot for a wide open goal. Sometimes my defenders just dont even move to play defense. Everytime I try to attack, the other teams defenders make a tackle and keep the ball for their team leaving my team wide open for a counter attack, that my defenders do not even go defend. Goalies are basically useless as they dont like to defend either. The only way you can win is if the game wants you to. Everytime I get a chance at goal, somehow the goalie saves my shots or they all hit the post. I use the same shot in every other fifa and have scored thousands of goals. The only way to win is if the game chooses to let you win, I have a good team yet way worse teams keep shitting on my team. This game is dogshit and I wish someone would release a competitor soccer game that we can all switch to. Also the pack weight in ultimate is absolute shit. I would rather drag my balls through broken glass then play this shitty ass game. DO NOT BUY this shit even if it goes on sale. Save yourself and your sanity."

Counter-Strike,10,178800740,"Counter-Strike 1.6 — это не просто игра, а целая эпоха! Если бы у видеоигр был свой Олимп, то CS 1.6 определенно сидела бы на троне и раздавала всем медали за ""Лучший шутер всех времен"".

Графика? Ну, да, она напоминает картины великих мастеров, только вместо масляных красок тут — пиксели, которые, похоже, были нарисованы в перерывах между уроками информатики. Но разве это важно, когда ты можешь швырять гранаты так, что противники начинают звать на помощь своих мам?

А звуки? Звук стрельбы в CS 1.6 — это как музыка для ушей, но только если у вас плохой слух. Каждый выстрел — это как маленький фейерверк, а когда попадаешь в противника, ощущение, что ты только что завоевал Оскар!

Не могу не отметить, сколько эмоций вызывает игра! Здесь ты можешь быть и тактическим гением, и безумным Рэмбо одновременно. Если ты вдруг решишь, что бежать с ножом на врагов — это отличная идея, то, скорее всего, ты окажешься в анналах истории как ""человек, который слишком увлекся"".

И, конечно, нельзя забыть о нашем любимом ""КТ против ТТ"". Эта борьба — как противостояние между котами и собаками, только ставки выше, а шутки о ""папке"" — на месте.

В общем, Counter-Strike 1.6 — это как хороший старый друг, который всегда рядом, чтобы поднять настроение, даже если вы только что зашли на сервер и вас тут же убили с ""первого выстрела"" — снова! Так что берите в руки мышь, надевайте наушники и вперед, на поле боя! Бум!"

Dead by Daylight,381210,177353872,"[h1]Is this game worth the money?[/h1]
----------------------
Gameplay? Yes
Replay value? Yes
Community? Hell no.
----------------------
This game has a massive playerbase problem on both sides of the spectrum, in 1 corner you've a group of 4 individuals constantly complaining about perks, add-ons, offering brought, hell in most cases even the killer the enemy chooses.

And on the other spectrum is a god-complex having maniac trying their damn hardest to be playing the game in many ways it's not meant to be and calling it a ''strategy'' & Countering said playstyle by mentioning ''Should've brought ........ perk'' Like it's clear from the start the way someones gonna be playing.
----------------------------
Entitlement runs in the blood of DBD players and it impacts the game in a negative manner, players be targeting people for the charms, the character they play. ''I tunnel sable mains out because _____ reason''

And on the other spectrum theres 

''I DC because screw ______ killer''
------------------------------------

This is burned into about 90% of the player base, you've people actively going out their way to ensure someone doesn't get an achievement, people blocking exists, generators, doors, pallets.

killers holding games hostage, slugging people till everybody bleeds out regardless the playstyle of the survivors, making it their gods given goal to remove someone out the game.
------------------------------------

This is 90% of ur games, the other 10%?? Are the absolute best moments you'll have with friends, drunk by daylight, perk roulette, just any challenge to spice up the game. Funny quirky builds, you name it. 

Are what makes the 90% acceptable. But it's not the standard for a game this old.
---------------------------------------------

Do not even get me started on the optimisation of this game, a decade old bloodweb mechanic that is severly lacking, no adjustable sound options, minimal accessibility options, constant frame stutters, spikes, glitches & game breaking bugs. 
----------------------------------------------

That's DBD for you. From someone with a combined playtime of 3k hours."
Dead by Daylight,381210,177800998,"This game is literally what Stockholm Syndrome feels like. It grabs you and keeps you help captive until it's all you can think about, all you can dream about and all you can see when you close your eyes. 
I HATE IT HERE! BUT I WANNA STAY!
I repair generators in my dreams, I hear the huntress's lullaby like a constant tinnitus ring in my ears.
I wanna be happy again. 
I wanna be who I was before I played this game.
But I know that cannot be since the further away I get the more the sirens sing to lure me back...
I am forever trapped in an endless cycle.
I've truly been captured by the entity and there is no escape.
Solid game you should try it, 8/10."
Dead by Daylight,381210,177211619,"Love/Hate relationship with this guy.  Probably a slight addiction to it.  Developers don't address the in game play issues and continue to allow the behavior that is off putting to continue.  Tunneling, Slugging and Bad Manners run rampant."
Dead by Daylight,381210,177497420,"This game is highly addictive and the events this game has have been fun. Yeah you are going to have toxic people, but what game doesn't. My only complaint is that the devs don't listen to their community very well and implement things that aren't what the game needs. Overall, I would say give this game a go if you have some friends to play as survivor or go in solo as a killer."
Dead by Daylight,381210,177899226,"There was a point where Dead by Daylight was fun to play on both killer & survivor. However, the developers changes to the matchmaking system, perk balance & business practices really kills the game for me.

The matchmaking is a mixed bag & generally takes too long to find a lobby, especially if you're in a full group. Waiting 5+ minutes to find a match will often last longer than the match themselves. The skill gap between solo queue & group queue can be quite big.

When the developers decided to nerf Iron Will a few years back, that's when you know they got no idea on perk balance. I'm not 100% sure on the reason, but usage shouldn't be the only factor. Don't worry, Iron Will was eventually revert to it's nearly good state & now is only held back by it's exhaustion restriction.

They've removed non-licensed DLC such as Tools of Torment & Forged in Fog, then bundled them into the Endless Hunt Pack. However, this bundle doesn't apply a discount for any owned DLC meaning that if you're only missing 1 DLC, then you'll have to pay more than the original price. While this Endless Hunt Pack includes the DLC exclusive items, good luck trying to get them in the Terror Expansion Pack or Escape Expansion Pack.

Abysmal compensation in general, such as Leatherface hidden masks getting removed to side step an issue affecting a minority of the player base while still not fully addressing it. The amount was 600 Iridescent Shards & honestly should've been Auric Cells due to the fact this DLC has to be brought with real money."
Dead by Daylight,381210,177234773,"I had fun with this game. But I don't get the massive appeal for it.

The community is not great. People are mean and quite toxic for zero reason, that made my experience quite frustrating (I'm talking t-bags, stuff like this).

And most importantly, I started to get bored around 7 hours in. The generators mechanic starts being very boring very quickly since it's all about pressing a key and then the spacebar every 5/10 seconds. They should add more variety to that, other minigames.

Like it's okay for a lil, but past some time it's just always the same thing.

I don't think DBD is worth 20 euros. Get it on sale!!"
Dead by Daylight,381210,177186064,"Biggest time lost you can find, do you want a balanced game, good graphics, good community, changes that were put thought into? if so, this isn't it.
There's about 36 killers right now, and you will only see about 6 of them. You will quite frequently see survivors quit or surrender, bcs there's nothing to do on some matchups.
This is genuinely the only game i've ever played that i think the devs are trying to make it more and more unfun."
Dead by Daylight,381210,177786844,"Wow, where to even start? Playing this game feels like getting dragged back to kindergarten, where everyone is more focused on flexing their egos than on actual gameplay. It's almost like the developers built this for people desperate to compensate for... other shortcomings. The mechanics are a joke, designed to reward the loudest, most obnoxious players rather than those actually trying to play. Save yourself the frustration – unless you're here for ego trips and mind-numbing grind, you'd get more satisfaction playing with building blocks."
Dead by Daylight,381210,177099013,"Killers and SWFs will optimize the fun out of the game for both sides.
If you don't play in a SWF, you're better off playing killer so that way you have complete control over your win conditions. And even if you're not winning as killer, you still get to play the game... 

Unlike losing as a solo survivor where you're prone to everything awful about this game, which is:
Getting knockout/third seal slugged for 4 minutes straight.
Getting hard tunneled out.
Getting proxy camped on hook.
Getting left to struggle or die on first hook(without or more depressingly with Kindred).
Teammates making bad decisions and not playing optimally when it's painfully obvious how to do so.
Teammates unknowingly trolling you in a variety of ways.
Teammates knowingly trolling you in a variety of ways.

All the while, the community plays Devil's Advocate and blames you for not playing a very certain way to prevent all of these things, which I've come to discover that everyone should be using at least 2 of these perks every game:

Unbreakable - To punish the killer for slugging you, but sometimes your teammates will still go on a suicide mission to pick you up and typically any pressure you would have alleviated is wasted. You could also use No Mither, but this is just going to force the killer to hook you because they know you have permanent Unbreakable from the very beginning of the match.
Also, you really only ever get use out of this when the killer does decide to slug you, otherwise the presence of this perk will not be felt most of the time. Still, the more popular this perk is, the better for survivors because it will make killers think twice about slugging you, which is extremely boring.

Anti-Tunneling Perks Decisive Strike, and/or Off the Record - To punish the killer for attempting to hard tunnel you out of the match. These actually work quite nicely when the killers do decide to tunnel you. Otherwise, DS and the Endurance from OTR is basically a wasted perk slot. But just like Unbreakable prevents killers from predominantly slugging, the presence and popularity of these perks act as a floodgate for preventing the prevalence of tunneling.

That's about all you can do really, aside from generally being good at looping, but the killer can and will always eventually get the better of you.
It sucks that you're pretty much forced to use 2-3 perk slots to stop the killer from just playing efficiently, but that's how the developers made it work."
Dead by Daylight,381210,177847995,"Despite popular belief I like the game. More fun as a casual experience than to take it wayyyy too seriously. Killer cue should prooooobably be skipped on a bad day, but can be oddly relaxing for me personally. Not balanced, but a game doesn't have to be to be enjoyable."
Dead by Daylight,381210,178258163,"Personally - I love this game. I'm a fan of third person point-of-view, horror aesthetics, and shorter games. Each match is (typically) 20 minutes or less. I didn't want to make a super long review, so i just listed pros and cons below, then note for new survivors. .
Pros: 
+Accessibility options for the deaf/hard-of-hearing and color blindness
+Multiplayer across platforms
+Consistent on events and new characters - which keeps bringing me back!

Cons:
-High rates of toxicity from players
-Each update feels like it leans to either killer side or survivor side. It feels like every killer main thinks its survivor sided, but then every survivor main thinks its killer sided. 
-Random disconnects are bound to happen. 
-Some updates create for more toxic behaviors... right now it's mori the last survivor.. ruins end game play. 

MAJOR NOTE TO NEW PLAYERS:
+This isn't a game for people who expect to ""win"". The goal for each side is clear: kill survivors or escape. However, this doesn't mean you ""win"" if you escape or got a 4k (all survivors). What matters most is how you play the game. The more points gathered from chases, gens, hooks, etc. the more likely you'll rank/level up. Survivor deaths are called ""sacrifices"" for a reason. 
+Most streamers say this, and I agree - HOURS MATTER. I've played about 2k hours and hit Rank 1 every season. But I am still a ""noob"". This game has a lot more strategy and patience than I initially gave it credit for."
Dead by Daylight,381210,177367237,"This game is honestly trash, and Killer sided 100%. The Devs always and will always make adjustments to the game based on any complains from killers, Ignoring or ruining any perks or plays survivors can try to make to just survive. The one thing this game has going for it, is that it is still alive. All other horror games keep dying due to devs not updating and not releasing new things. I have had this game on PS4,PS5,Steam for Years, playing with friends. I don't recommend this game to anyone, as the Dev do not care to make the game fair for everyone, they get some killer having trouble and complaining and jump though."
Dead by Daylight,381210,177158793,"Dead by daylight is one of the best horror games you can play today, a gradual increase in tension resulting from the unshakable sense of impending doom that it manages to do this in an asymmetrical competitive action game is what truly impressive about it. It is without peer in the asymmetrical competitive multiplayer arena, and has grown into one of the most robust horror experiences around. Playing with friends is mandatory, as it greatly enhances the overall experience."
Dead by Daylight,381210,177892858,"As of right now, I wouldn't recommend buying this game unless you're already invested in the licensed characters of media present within it. The game is currently at a state where it feels miserable, truthfully. Playing the game the intended way- i.e. Not Ragequitting, using a variety of perks and playstyles, or even trying to win will punish you. Solo queueing as survivor will result in your teammates leaving the game, or trying to get you killed on purpose. Bringing other perks as Killer or Survivor, or even trying non ""meta"" playstyles as either side will often get you a loss at higher MMR, which is perplexing. The game does not reward you for playing as intended. You would have a much better use of your time if you DC'd, and got off the game completely. Or even- playing meta, or just ragequitting. However, if you somehow manage to get a victory- you will be rewarded with even harder matches, where once again, the meta play- or just leaving the game, are rewarded. As sticking out the match will result in you being left in a game full of bots.

TLDR; the game punishes you for playing it as intended. Respect for other players is not rewarded as it should be, and refusing to play the game, and toxicity as whole- are not discouraged. I have no idea how things have quite amounted to this point, because if anything, I wish they hadn't."
Dead by Daylight,381210,178274420,"You can say it's general, but Ghostfaces and Myers will always have a soft spot in my heart :') Also, love the thrill of getting chased. Perfect game for that. But if you wanna seek for revenge go and be a killer. It's more than just hide and seek game. As teamwork is very important. So does the skill to avoid getting hit, or think when to do what particular actions. One day I'll learn. So far I love playing as Jill or Ada <3 (where are my Leon mains at?) One sad part is I haven't played this game earlier, while it sat in my library :') Because I was hooked (get it) - immediatelly. <3"
Dead by Daylight,381210,178818635,"Don't get into this game, it unfortunately is one of the only live service Asymmetrical game that gets constant updates and provides an unique experience that you can't get anywhere, being able to play as Iconic horror film characters in a cat and mouse chase simulator is and can be very fun, the original killers they have are also unique and they all provide unique gameplay, you WILL find a killer you like and fall in love with their gameplay loop.

Playing survivor is also fun when you learn how to loop and how to use several items and perks, the killer provides different gameplay styles and there is much to learn.

Whats the problem then? First off, the horrid perk system that makes you have to spend a ton of money getting DLCs to have a semi viable build, some perks that provide counters to certain playstyles are not avaible for either side at base. Some of the strongest perks in the game are locked behind a pay or grind wall that will have you spend 5 to 8 hours grinding to first get the perk if you can even get it for free, or leveling up the character you got it on so you can share it to other characters, meaning that a good portion of your early gameplay will be with improvised builds that you don't like or are not even that good.

Second, SBMMR is divided into 4 brackets to separate players in their ""proper"" skill bracket, the last one is so wide it basically covers anyone with a few hundred hours that learned the game quickly and/or are just good to players that have 10k+ hours and play every single day for 10 hours. This bracket isn't too hard to reach and the worst part is you don't even know what MMR you are at, it's hidden. Meaning that after you start consistently winning as either side you will start getting harder and harder matches and if you've ever played multiplayer PVP games you know what that means:

- Less build variety as you have to rely on more ""meta"" perks.
- Less killer variety as only the stronger killers can compete with a gen efficient team.
- Less strategy variety as Survivors focus more and more solely on getting gens done quickly and Killers focus on getting one person out as quickly as possible.

This game at an above average level is basically exploiting bad game design choices and those become apparent QUICK when everyone on the match has an idea of what they are doing. Let it be some Survivor perks, Killer strategies, Items or whatever.

The balancing is also a mixed bag of ""They cooked so hard with this"" and ""What the hell are they doing"".

Do yourself a favor, don't get into this game, if you do you will have fun at the start, play more, start getting harder matches and hate yourself, but you will keep coming back because there is NOTHING else that can scratch the itch like this game does."
Dead by Daylight,381210,178299016,"This game almost never runs well. I am far above the recommended specs but this game always runs at an average of 20 fps. 
(the settings don't matter, it runs poorly regardless of settings, but yes the absolute lowest settings don't make a single difference) 

The game itself is really fun and great, but it becomes really hard to enjoy when you're  basically watching a powerpoint presentation each time you play."
Dead by Daylight,381210,178803721,"Dead By Daylight will keep you coming back because it's an inherently fun concept, and particularly fun with Kill Your Friends custom matches. However, it feels like it's managed by a developer that's shockingly ignorant about the state of their game, and will try to squeeze every cent out of you. Let's talk about:

(1) Maps. The disparity in maps is absolutely insane, and the community has been begging BHVR to fix them for almost a decade. Some maps are massive and incredibly survivor-sided. Other maps are incredibly small, and make the killer extremely oppressive. Some maps have a ton of verticality, which makes some perks and killers incredibly strong. Other maps have almost none, which renders some perks useless. Some maps have the most useless pallets that give the survivors a huge advantage. Other maps have incredibly strong pallets in such large quantities that the killer struggles to get anything done. To exacerbate this, map offerings exist, where a killer or a survivor can make it overwhelmingly likely that they'll be sent to a map that's perfect for them. It's such a meme at this point, that it's known within the community that players who use map offerings very commonly ragequit if they don't get the map they want, or if the match doesn't go exactly how they want.

(2) Killer disparity. There's an incredibly large difference in the base strength of the game's 37 killers. Some have very few tools, are almost never updated, and have become a joke. Newer killers seem to have an overwhelming variety of tools. Some designs are incredibly outdated at this point, and haven't really gotten any love from the devs. Additionally, the devs adding 3 new perks for every killer and survivor has introduced a massive amount of bloat into the game, and you're continually incentivized to buy more chapters/killers to just have a viable build.

(3) Add-ons. There are a stupid number of killer add-ons that add random exposed statuses, or have disgustingly overpowered effects. Survivor add-ons can also be incredibly powerful, when you talk about Styptics, Syringes, Brand New Parts, etc. BHVR attempted to balance these by making the best add-ons rarer, but this has a major problem: the game has been out for almost 9 years. At this point, some players have an almost unlimited quantity of powerful add-ons, and it puts newer players at an extreme disadvantage. The entire system needs to be reworked because add-ons can annihilate the game quality on both sides extremely easily.

(4) The meta. The game does a terrible job to try and get you to play it in the way the devs intend. The most fun games are close, and tend to be a little bit lengthy because of it. The devs want you (and encourage you through their scoring system) to spread hooks, get in a lot of chases, and generally have both sides interact with each other consistently throughout the game. However, the best way to actually win is to completely circumvent this. Survivors who are playing to win are incentivized to gen-rush and finish the game as quickly as possible. Killers can almost guarantee 3 kills per match if they camp and tunnel a survivor until they're dead, and then slug from there. This creates an environment where both sides are encouraged to play in a way that's actively un-fun for the other. Killers who don't play ""mean"" simply don't get to play the game when a 4-man Survive With Friends stack can end the match in less than 5 minutes. Survivors end up in games where they either get tunneled out immediately, or end up slugged for minutes at a time. In either scenario, they're literally not allowed to play the game. It's a frustrating scenario where doing silly shenanigans is incredibly fun, but you'll never get a chance if the other side is playing ""optimally.""

(5) Non-interactive mechanics. The devs continually add things into the game that are practically un-counterable. Are you bringing a build entirely based around flashlight saves? Well, the killer brought Lightborn, so your flashlights have literally no effect. You can get in situations where a survivor places a chemical trap on a god pallet. If they play with any intelligence, that's just ""chase over"" immediately. Are you in a situation where you need to kick a generator quickly? Better hope there isn't a blast mine on it, since the killer literally cannot see them (even though survivors can). Maybe you're in a situation where there's only one pathway to a generator you need to do, and Trapper has put a trap blocking it. Well, better hope he doesn't have Bloody Coil, which will injure you even if you disarm it successfully. Long story short, there are a bunch of mechanics that either cancel another mechanic/build entirely, or have very little outplay potential.

(6) The matchmaking. DBD relies on skill-based matchmaking that doesn't even function half the time. A friend playing on a brand new account was matched against a killer with over 4,000 hours. Sometimes, as a killer, I've been matched against a team of survivors that clearly has no idea what they're doing, and the match quality suffers for it. At the same time, the better you play, the more likely you are to start being matched against Survive With Friends bully squads who will make the match hell for you. Essentially, the better you play, the higher the likelihood that your match quality will drastically decrease. At the same time, you're going to encounter some games where you're matched against people who are clearly  way outside of your skill range in either direction. You can usually count on the fact that about 50% of your games will be extremely un-fun, for one reason or another.

TLDR: The format of the game is compelling, and it can be incredibly fun when everyone is doing some silly/cool/fun shenanigans. However, the meta and environment created by the devs is so incredibly poor that DBD will have you pulling your hair out more often than not.

P.S. Buff Piggy"
Dead by Daylight,381210,178721306,"This game need to die as fast as possible.
Survivor are unbalanced as hell. Since two seasons the only meta is gen rush.
If you try to chase a survivor for 5 or more seconds the game is done. Survivor do not need any kind of skill, because every skillful mechanic got removed during the last few seasons.

If you are a survivor main you will have a lot of fun to play Dead by Daylight, but as a killer main its one of the most boring and frustrating experience you can imagine.

Maybe the devs will improve the game balance but until this moment i can not recommend DbD to any killer main."

The game feels choppy and laggy, even when I clear my RAM and shut down all other applications before launching it.

The biggest downside? Players can’t even choose their own server! PUBG claims to select the nearest server for optimal ping, but it’s clearly doing the opposite. I often find myself dealing with unbearable latency that ruins the gameplay experience, even though my setup should easily handle the game.

If PUBG allowed players to manually choose their server, it would help tremendously. Gamers want control over their settings, and choosing a stable server is a huge part of that.

UFO 50,1147860,178233235,"This game (really 50 games) is arguably the best value you're going to find on steam. At 50 cents a game, it's a no brainer.  Unless retro style graphics make you physically ill, there's no reason not to buy this. This is what games from the 80s would have been like if they had the benefit of 40 years of reflection on what makes game design good. 

Just buy it."
UFO 50,1147860,177659746,"[h1]So what's the deal with this game?[/h1]
UFO 50 is a compilation of 50 games created by the devs behind Spelunkey, Downwell, and Skorpulac among others. It's set in the fictional gaming system LX-III, a console which takes inspiration from 1980s consoles and personal computers, such as the MSX and NES. These are games that vary in scope and size, but act as solitary experiences. Some are very long, taking as long as 20 hours to beat. Each game is retro-inspired but have their own unique twist that makes each one standalone. Genres are all over the place, from platformers to puzzles to full-blown strategy and even a JRPG ala Deltarune. It's a huge labor of love that took over 7 years to finish, with tons of secrets and unlockable achievement-style rewards to keep players coming back.



[h1]Do I have to unlock all the games?[/h1]
NO. Right from the start, you have EVERY game, as well as a quick and easy way to categorize by genre, multiplayer, and amount of time played. You don't even have to play them in order: just play whichever one you want. However, I recommend starting with Pilot Quest as soon as possible. You can read why in my short recommended games list below.



[h1]Are there any bad games?[/h1]
Having played them all, I would say that a vast majority of them are extremely solid. Some are difficult or have odd design quirks, but for the most part it is an extremely solid list of games. There's just hit after hit, and I'm personally so excited for it that I would consider the compilation itself a solid contender for Game of the Year.


The games that might not be a hit for you could be the following, which other players complained about. Doesn't mean they're bad perse, just that there's mixed opinions on them:

- BARBUTA: This is an adventure game inspired by games like Citadel for the BBC Micro. Personally, it reminds me more of Spider-Man for DOS. A very simple but very slow game where you are a knight hatched from an egg attempting to explore the castle and defeat the boss. It's purposefully designed with cheap one-hit deaths, but a ton of room to find plenty of secrets the more you're willing to be patient explore. It is the most retro of retro out of every game on the list, and is the first on the list chronologically. Maybe it sets a bad taste in your mouth, maybe it doesn't, but whatever you're feeling is very much intentional.

- MOONCAT: As praised as it is hated, this is an obtuse platformer where you play as a literal bean with legs and traverse to the end while avoiding obstacles. Seems straightforward, except the game uses only two buttons for every action, including movement. That means the D-pad acts as one button while the buttons on your right thumb (A, B, etc) act as the second button. The way your character controls is odd, but very clever, and I won't spoil it for you. It's an unexpected treat to play this game, and I'd say give it a proper chance before you judge it too harshly.

- COMBATANTS: Definitely the most hated on the list. This is a simple RTS game similar to Pikmin where you are a blue ant building an army to destroy the red ants before they destroy you. As simple as it sounds, it's very slow, and the AI is pretty obtuse. It's also very hard, as the red ants deal more damage and take more hits to kill. It takes a lot of patience to play this game, and it's probably not for you if you're like me and get frustrated easily.



[h1]The best ones?[/h1]
It was hard to narrow it down to just a few, but here's some games you might really enjoy:

- PILOT QUEST: An idle/adventure game where you're a space pilot who crash-landed on an alien planet, now on a mission to find the parts to your spaceship. A mix of Legend of Zelda 1 and Cookie Clicker, you're able to collect resources automatically, even when you switch to another game. Once in a while, you're able to spend limited resources to go out into the wild and explore, but make sure you return before the time runs out or you won't collect what you've earned. Dungeon and item locations are also randomized, so it makes for a slightly different experience each time you play. A super addicting game, and highly recommend starting this one ASAP so you don't miss out on resources.

- PARTY HOUSE: The fan-favorite. This is very similar to a random card draw game where you're the host of a happenin' 80s party, and you invite guests over by clicking on the front door, which brings in a random guest from your Rolodex guest list. End the party with tons of guests and cash in Popularity resources to expand your guest list. Make your house bigger with Cash to invite more guests at one party. However, some guests can be trouble: have 3 or more people who cause trouble, and someone calls the police, ending the round early. The game ends when you invite four Star Guests, such as aliens, dinosaurs, and mermaids, all with different abilities. It's super original, easy to get into, and a blast to play with friends. This is definitely a must-play if you purchase this game.

- MIN & MAX: One of the longest games on the list. This is a huge Metroidvania game in the style of Super Mario Bros. 2 meets Alice in Wonderland. Play as a little girl named Min as you shrink down in size and explore the vast world of the Closet, making friends with all sorts of little things like bugs, toys, and dust bunnies. Later on, a whole other world begins to open up, making what seems to be an 8-hour game into a 20-hour exploration game. Tons of people to meet to help with their problems, as well as new abilities to float, store items, and command enemies. Not to mention it's extremely adorable and great for kids. If you've got the time, this is a very fun and satisfying experience.

- AVIANOS: A very simplistic turn-based strategy game in which you manage bird soldiers to capture and hold castles. Pray to different deities for different actions, and build up your army to rush the enemy castle. Attacks are done on-screen in a semi-automatic way with a few minor control options at the bottom to give outnumbered soldiers a fighting chance. Even if you can learn all the rules fairly quickly, the depth of this game is surprisingly pretty vast as there are tons of ways you can take the game. The story mode is unfortunately very short (3 levels), but there are many trials afterward if you want to put your skills to the test. There's also 2 player versus with a lot of home rules to mess with in the options setting.

Keep in mind that there are tons of other games that fit into many more genres. I've only mentioned 7, and there's 43 other games on this list. Try them all out!



[h1]Verdict[/h1]
This is an amazing lineup of games for all players. Even if this game is retro-inspired at heart, there are still a ton of clever modern mechanics that they use to keep a lot of games from being too frustrating. Half of the games are two-player, and is highly recommended for Steam Deck. If any of this sounds interesting, this is a must-buy, even at full price. You'll get more than your money's worth out of the amount of hours you'll be spending.

UFO 50,1147860,177406297,"It's pretty impossible to fully describe what you get diving into a game like UFO50. On one end, you get a massive variety of games to pick from, each with their own unique gameplay and mechanics to suit anyone looking for their next favorite. On the other end, a large number of these games are FULL MULTI-HOUR TITLES that could have been individual releases in their own right, making me question my own sanity and will continue to make me question the quality of other games by comparison.

You Like Balatro? You'll like this.
Metroid? That too.
Bloons? For sure.
Zelda 1? Absolutely.
Double Dragon? Yep yep.
You brought up Snake? Why Snake? I mean yea we've got it and it's fantastic, just didn't think you'd ask about Snake.

At 50 cents a game, each game is WAY more than worth that price. So many great minds have come together for a project that could not be MORE worth your time and money. Please play UFO50, you will love it!"
UFO 50,1147860,177158986,"I bought this game because I kept hearing good things about it, a friend kept telling me I gotta try this, said it's right up my alley. I loaded up the first game, called Barbuta. The game starts, I see my character in the middle of an empty room, I press right to walk right and one second later I'm dead. 10/10 gaming experience.

I see now why UFO 50 is the highest rated game of 2024 on Metacritic. It's a game for actual gamers. And there's something to be found for everyone!"
UFO 50,1147860,177186324,"A retro pick n mix in a delightful mixture of styles and genres that also makes me very mad because it also includes basically every flavour of retro BS under the sun. I absolutely respect the audacity of its concept and it actually follows through on its vision really well on the whole, you will find plenty to like in UFO 50 no matter what kind of games you like. But also you will probably find plenty that makes you cross, both due to the sheer variety and again, because UFO 50 leans somewhat hard overall?

pingolf da greatest, but also it's the worst, but actually it's the best one nope the ball bounced all the way back to the start, it's the worst one but actually it's a hole in one which means its the best one. oh i love the fifty ufo games but actually i hate the ufo fifty games but actually i love them"
UFO 50,1147860,177054642,"So far this falls more into the ""this is cool"" and ""I respect it"" sort of feelings from me rather than ""this is fun"" or ""I recommend buying this if you'd like to have a good time.""

I've still got a ways to go, halfway through, but so far I regret buying it -- something I respect much more than I enjoy. And the games that it pays homage to... I'd rather just go play those."
UFO 50,1147860,178136451,"Very impressed at how deep each game is. For a game which is a collection of 50 games you'd think each one would be surface level mini games. Surprisingly, each game is fleshed out and can offer hours and hours of content. Some of them are very difficult too. It shows the best sides of 80's era videogames in a complete package. I could see completionists taking hundreds of hours to get everything done. If I had a complaint, it would be the odd choice to only have two buttons for all 50 games. It felt like a needlessly limiting constraint for some of the more complex games. Otherwise a pretty fun game."
UFO 50,1147860,177231771,"Had a lot of enjoyment out of this . A good ""one last try"" thing and a decent variety of old style games, some with modern twists. Bit of a surprise to find an idle game and a deck builder in here. - A full on old fashioned JRPG too. - The quality and gameplay of the arcadey games is spot on. D-Pad throwbacks."
UFO 50,1147860,177379491,"Made me remember what i loved about gaming. Discovering games, learning their rules, and figuring it all out by yourself. Deceptively simple games that use a dpad and 2 buttons. Huge variety, guaranteed to love a handful of the games at least"
UFO 50,1147860,177412502,"Not for me. I appreciate the theme of retro gaming and the creativity of many of these games. I just don't care for platformers and games that I have to play over and over to figure out the pattern or goal. I find this more frustrating than fun, but I can see how others may enjoy it."
UFO 50,1147860,177005448,"I feel after 50 hours of UFO 50, I should probably review it. This is one of the most ambitious video games I've ever played, and it's surpassed my expectations in almost every way.

When I was a young kid, I remember finding one of those ""100 in 1"" game devices at a Radio Shack, and pestering my parents to get it for me. 7-year old me was not so concerned about the quality of the games, but was rather impressed by how so many games could seemingly fit onto something that vaguely resembled a Game Boy Advance! Big surprise, none of the games on this device turned out to be half as good as any game from the system it was trying to imitate, but I still had fun with it and remember it fondly. While I'm sure now that most of the games I had played on it were little more than cheap bootlegs or knock offs of other games, the fun of diving into a new game, not knowing what to expect, and trying to figure out how to play it was an enjoyable experience for me.

So when UFO 50 was revealed several years ago, I wondered if this experience I had as a kid could be recreated by an indie studio, but this time with 50 video games that were competent enough to stand on their own. Now that I've gotten to play it, I think Mossmouth nailed it. This collection genuinely transports me back to a time when I didn't know how the sausage was made with video games, I could dive into a new experience with no hand holding, and just have fun with a random game for a little bit. 

I think you can tell pretty quickly whether or not this game is for you just by looking at it. None of the 50 games included in UFO 50 are ""retro-inspired"" games in the sense that they are modern-feeling games with pixel graphics, like many other indie games. Each game in this collection feel authentic to NES/Genesis-era hardware and game design, but with inspiration from every era of gaming. 

A typical game in UFO 50 takes the foundation of a game from the 80's-90's and put a unique spin on it, often by incorporating a mechanic from modern games, indie or otherwise. Want to play Metroid with the gravity-switching gameplay of VVVVVV? Try Vainger! How about Rally-X but with the floor-painting gameplay of Splatoon? Then try Paint Chase. What about The Legend of Zelda, but with... cookie clicker elements??? Then check out Pilot Quest. I don't want to explain any more because a lot of the fun from this collection comes from dusting off a game, booting it up for the first time, and seeing what unique idea the developers come up with.

Despite playing 50 hours, I have yet to try all of the games, because I found myself getting lost in a lot of the ones I really enjoyed. Games like Attactics, Porgy, and Mini and Max are surprisingly meaty, and can take a few hours to finish. Other games like Onion Delivery and Fist Hell are more bite-sized, arcade-style games that are quick to finish but challenging to make it to the end of. There are a couple of stinkers in the collection (I didn't care for Hot Foot and I'd rather not talk about Combatants), but each game in this collection brings something unique to the table, and is at the very least interesting to check out, whether you wind up liking it or not. 

All the games in UFO 50 are themed around a development company that made games throughout the 80's and 90's, and as such, you will see recurring characters across games, sequels to games in the collection, and developers in the credits of each game that come and go. I feel like there is a unique story to UFOSoft that I haven't fully dove into yet. And what could that terminal in the menu be used for...?

So if you have a fondness for old games, are willing to put up with ""old-school"" difficulty, and enjoy exploring unique ideas and mechanics in video games, I can't recommend UFO 50 enough. I am super excited to put 50 more hours into this collection, and then probably another 50 after that.

P.S. Here are some of my favorite games from the collection, if you pick this game up yourself and are wondering where to start:

+ Magic Garden
+ Attactics
+ Mooncat (GOTY 2024)
+ Bushido Ball
+ Campanella
+ Hyper Contender
+ Night Manor"
UFO 50,1147860,176980188,"you get 50 games for like 30 dollars canadian or so but at least 25 of these games are worth the cost of that alone, so you get 49 other games for free 25 times = 1225 free games for the price of 1 which is the greatest value product in the history of consumer entertainment

its genuinely mind melting how varied this game is and how often they manage to switch genres entirely and still deliver, its like watching someone pitch a perfect game in the major leagues and then go score a hat trick in the NHL before achieving a 2500 chess rating and then benching a thousand pounds. 

there's even some weird ARG meta puzzle stuff about the fictional gaming company if you care about that kind of gameplay, i dont at all but it feels pretty scummy to be complaining about extra content in a game with more high quality stuff in it than most of us will ever get around to playing."
UFO 50,1147860,178211122,"Buy this. This whole collection is remarkable and might get you into genres of games you never thought you'd like until given such a fine treatment. Most of the games are hard and punishing, but the sheer quality and fun will keep you coming back for more.

Aesthetically there's an incredible dedication to the collection's ""hardware limitations"", with UFO having its own selected palette, SFX, and tracker music to really sell the authenticity of its classic design. It's been worked on for several years by the team, and it shows.

Support these devs and buy this game if you love a good challenge and a fun variety of genre-breaking creative entries. My personal favorite is Rakshasa: A very difficult platformer that plays off of Ghouls n' Ghosts with the gimmick of you being able to cheat death as many times as you can get away with.

This collection's gotten me out of a lousy depressive slump and I can't recommend it enough."
UFO 50,1147860,177929104,"A fair warning to the people getting interested in this pack of games due to all the overwhelming praise it's receiving, and why it's an issue reviewing a game containing 50 of them. This is a compilation of games created with the price point and thought process of you not enjoying all 50 of them, so if you purchase UFO 50 expecting all of them to be enjoyable for its price, you might get an underwhelming experience based on the expectations you've set for yourself, especially since the majority of these games despite manageable, can get on the intense side for their difficulty.

[h1]Overview[/h1]
      [*]   This is a collection of 50 NES themed games that stand out even for the people who might've not experienced the NES times but simply enjoy consuming indies in general. That description undercuts in what i consider this to be an achievement in gaming, it can frankly border on overwhelming for its sheer magnitude of how extensive many of these 50 games are.

      [*]   While they do emulate the NES style of graphics and gameplay, it's worth noting the advertised ""modern touch"" to them. That touch contains a layer of technical design that ties these games together for their replayability and visual charm, doing what i believe to be a successful translation with the person having the frame of reference on today's era of games. By replayability, on average we're talking a couple to even tens of hours in some of them, with even more if you're really getting into it by overcoming its full challenge, called the ""cherry"" completion.

      [*]   The UI design on the title selection screen is deceptively addictive to interact with, as it instigates the completionist in me to turn the cartridge from blue (game not beaten) to gold (game beaten) or especially cherry red (full completion). It gives that extra push to try out even the games not within my range of taste. [/list] 

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
      [*]   One of the most ambitious assemblage of genres across the board that impressed me thoroughly, with some even showcasing references in today's era of indie games. Many are short and compact where you die in one hit, requiring one sitting to complete them, others are more long form that can be continued later on. Even if the gimmick on some are one dimensional, i found it to be a well crafted dimension that doesn't overstay its welcome... aside for a few, whenever a certain puzzle game becoming a bit tedious with their longevity albeit not unbearable, while others in the RPG department can get a bit rough and punishing early on, but it's par for the course, as its momentum torpedoes pretty quick once you get a few upgrades.

      [*]   The majority of them are not a walk in the park, some quite on the harder side too, be it the lack of tutorials, counter-intuitive controls or their the trial and error structure, as they're purposefully obtuse to emulate the style of old NES. What game you might find easier, could be a more challenging experience for someone else, as it mostly depends on what genre of games your dexterity resides the best in. I for example am a roguelite fanatic and i've played NES games in the 90's, which renders a large number of these games as very enjoyable and also manageable in terms of difficulty and completion time. I did struggle with some of the technical ones though, and that onion delivery game just demolished me. This is an easy 100+ hours of content, and way beyond that if you're fully invested into completing many, if not all of them. One of them alone took me 20 hours to complete it.
[/list]

[h1]Story & Music[/h1]
      [*]   If you're motivated in playing a game for at least any form of a story, you won't find anything too sophisticated given the nature of the era it emulates. Some of these games barely contain any story, if at all, as they just plonk you into the gameplay with your character and not much of a plot, others do a short-form introductory cutscene and ending but that's mostly it. It is however worth noting the continuity between many of them, as some games are sequels, others reference each other, while some have easter eggs and re-used characters and enemies of past games. It might not be much to many, but this extra level of interconnected detail really adds to the charm that ties this all together, as they all serve the main over-arching story of a fictional developer and their progress on each game throughout the 80's, with some eerie undertones at the back of it.

      [*]   The music was also a great hit for me, likely contributed by nostalgia. It encapsulates the 8 bit feeling somewhat accurately, from the cheery and goofy, to the more dramatic metroid style. The tracks and sound design similarly share a continuity between some of the games, hearing familiar sound cues throughout the gameplay. Re-using assets and musical bites to a game or series of games would normally come at the detriment of the developer for looking like they're cutting corners, this however is one of the rare instances where it's a deliberate attention to detail for this colossal project that took 8 years to make. Some games have a complete lack of music however, which i understand the intention, despite still feeling they would've benefited with some ambient music.  [/list]


[h1]Summary[/h1]
Do exercise some caution on your expectations for it, as chances are that you will not be impressed by all 50 games inside this collection, perhaps not even a good first impression either. What many can find the intentionally clunky technical NES design as an endearing experience, others can rightfully find it irritating and unappealing. I would still very much recommend it wholeheartedly even for the people that might not get the full nostalgic package intended for not being born in that time period. One of my favorite game of the pack (Valbrace) contains an amalgamation of genres that i never really played or found appealing individually, but combined in such a creative manner, gave me one of my favorite experience throughout the entire list.

The 90's kid in me that plays mostly indies, with the cherry on top for being a sweaty completionist, makes UFO 50 my absolute favorite game(s) of this year, and it's a creative masterpiece that spoiled me to no end, with no regrets for being one of the few games i've bought at its full 24,50€ price. Many of the 50 games while inspired by other genres, feel very fresh and unique, that i can only hope this serves as a benchmark for future titles to expand upon those concepts. 





[i] One final note is to continue this chain of advice i got from other reviews and discussions in regards of an idle grind game way later in the pack called Pilot Quest (game #44) where upon being launched, it will remain active and generate resources while you play the other games, as long as UFO 50 itself is actively running. Would recommend launching that one at your earliest convenience, as personally i had more fun visiting that game as a comfort break while completing the pack. [/i]"
UFO 50,1147860,178590566,"possibly the highest value purchase possible on steam dot com. All of these games sport unique ideas and incredible execution, you can't find a 1 to 1 game comparison for any of these without downplaying their unique qualities. It has something for everyone, and the games you do mesh with will more than make the whole collection worth for you, despite the games you might not mesh with."
UFO 50,1147860,177283186,Limitations lead to great art. The design on display is fantastic and certainly get the most out of the imposed limitations they've put on themselves.
UFO 50,1147860,177123434,"Let me put it this way: I'm about 10 hours in and I have yet to try half of the games, let alone thoroughly play them (I've beaten 5 and sampled the rest). There is so much depth here. Other than a couple games that were clearly intentionally designed to be... uh, [i]interesting[/i], there are great games right from the ""early"" part of the catalog. For me, the standouts are the strategy and puzzle games, but almost every game has unique twists.

The flow of play is basically this: you look at a game's controls and a bit of flavor text about the ""company"" history if you want, and then jump in. There is no handholding and very little is explicitly explained, including sometimes the object of the game. It doesn't take long to get the gist of each game, but I've found it's pretty common to figure something new out after playing for a while that makes life much easier. Just like the old days...

The gameplay itself, though, usually strikes the right balance between old school feel and new school conventions that make play feel less bullshit than the olden days. Many of the games are quite challenging, but I'd say it's about one level below ""Nintendo hard"". The longer games like RPGs and puzzle adventures auto-save, and even some (not all) of the shorter ones helpfully save your progress mid-run.

I'll update this later as I play more, but as of right now I'm having a blast and highly recommend it."
UFO 50,1147860,177495514,"I have played about 30 of the 50 games at 75 hours. Of those, all except a select few have AT LEAST some fun to be had. Probably three quarters of those games are actively good, and 4-5 are EXCEPTIONAL. Keep in mind I have plenty of literal fan favorites left to play, I didn't leave the bad games for last. 
In general, the art direction for all games really stands out. From the backgrounds, to characters and enemies, almost all have fun, unique and COOL visual elements. The soundtrack is also pretty consistently good, even peaking with the occasional absolute banger. 
And finally, adding a progression element to the games really help. You can beat games for a gold disc, or cherry them by going above and beyond in some way. Chasing cherries, or golds is fun. In some cases, getting the cherry forces you to engage with the game in a deeper way, often increasing my enjoyment of said game in the process. 
Great value for 25 bucks"
UFO 50,1147860,178518757,"This pitch of this game makes it sound like you're getting 50 NES-Style mini/arcade games, which for the price would actually be a pretty worthwhile value.

What you get is about 30 real genuine retro-inspired full fledged video games, and 20 of the minigames you were expecting. The value is insane. Multiple games in this pack could charge $10 themselves on Steam and probably do well. For the price this is worth grabbing because the act of just grabbing at games at random is really fun and SOMETHING in here will click with you.

Highlights for me so far:
Night Manor - Retro horror point and click adventure with multiple endings. Genuinely spooky.
Warptank - Puzzle game about being a tank that can only teleport to whatever surface is vertical. It's got tons of levels and is really well designed and fun.
Valbrace - First person dungeon crawling mixed with Punch-out style combat. It's a blast. Get a notebook to draw your own map.
Grimstone - A FULL JRPG. IVE BEEN PLAYING FOR 10 HOURS. IT'S GREAT.
Fist Hell - Coop beat-em up that's really tough but fun.
Overbold - Smash TV but you have upgrades between rounds and can gamble on making the next round harder to get more cash to upgrade with. Tough but addicting.

I haven't even tried every game in here. There's so much. Get this."
UFO 50,1147860,178279744,"I'm sure it's already clear in the many existing reviews that is instantly a 40 year old classic. But I still want to applaud the developers on their accomplishment and encourage others to experience this game.

In my first couple hours of UFO 50, I was a bit put off by the retro trappings. The controls and ""feel"" of some of the early games comes can be fairly described as crude.

But I tried more of the games and found some that I just keep returning to. These games are comfy and nostalgic in how they look and play, yes, but nearly every one also has some little twist of game design that _at least_ makes the experience intriguing, and in some cases, addicting! And the more I've played, the more the conceit of this alternate-universe retro console has felt incredibly fun, and I've been practically thrilled to discover some of the LX-50's secrets :) Bravo to the devs!"
Deadlock,513790,40977438,The Devs have abandoned the game. Last update was over a year ago at this point; don't purchase.
Deadlock,513790,41351454,"Pretty much the same wave shooter you've already played. If you are into them, go for it.. Points for sound, and the absence of clunky reload mechanics.  Points for Tron style environment."
Deadlock,513790,47944384,"I lightly recommend this with the caveat that it's a pretty standard stationary/roomscale shooter, that you should only buy it at 85-90% off, and that it'll probably never leave Early Access. That said, it feels complete, the basics are solid, there's good audio, the visuals are pleasing, and the core gameplay is fun. You probably aren't gonna get a lot of solo play out of this but it's a good game to have installed when friends/guests want a quick n dirty VR experience. Straightforward arcade experience worth a buck."
Deadlock,513790,25482526,"Updated ea review:
This game has been abandoned by the developer. The game as it stands is a bug free working title, but just don't support developers who take your money and run. Just avoid. 

Old ea review:
This game is great in short stints, just like all the other wave based games. You drop in, play a few levels, die at the same level each time. Rinse and repeat and get a little bit further then die.

For the price it's great value, the gameplay is polished, the animations and fx are exellent. Nothing not to like; possibly the difficulty getting too hard to quick, maybe. That seems to same with all wave shooters, short levels that get incredibly hard quickly. I imagine having a larger room to dodge around would help alot.

It would be great if the odd powerup turned your gun into something like an overpowered grenade or rocket launcher for a short spell. Like other VR wave shooters currently around, the same enemy are repeated level after level. More enemy types, and end of level bosses would make this awesome."
Deadlock,513790,24940578,"It took me a couple restarts to get it working.

The game seems like a Space Pirate trainer clone, certainly because it shares the gameplay as well as some of the UI.
But it plays worse in almost every way.

The enemies take a lot more hits and do nothing more than run forward, stop and shoot.
And their animation quality is also sub par.

The guns overheat way too fast, making you unable to shoot for a short while.
Which is stupid, if the only mechanic in the game is shooting.

There are only 4 weapons:
A pistol where you have to keep triggering to shoot
A pistol where you have to keep triggering to shoot but sometimes is unable to shoot
A plasma rifle that overheats before you kill 1 strong enemy
And a laser that takes a while to charge

The shield is pretty big, which is great.
And it gives you the option to switch from picking it behind your back to pressing the grip buttons.
But this didn't work for me, so I sticked to picking it from my back.


Space Pirate trainer is much more polished than this one.
So if you can spare the 10€ extra, you should."
Deadlock,513790,25060841,"Just need shorter cool down/more gradual overheating of guns, then I think this game will be much more enjoyable. Still fun, just frustrating not being able to fire back for 3 seconds after gun overheats."
Deadlock,513790,133135570,"Skunkape Interactive abandoned it unfinished, after taking our money. NEVER support early access games with your hard earned money! However, it's a nice demo with big potential."
Deadlock,513790,101412047,"Had the potential for being a good game. Looks and plays good but it is not likely to get ever completed, unfortunately. I also dislike the lack of checkpoints. I still did like to play it overall."
Deadlock,513790,25455281,"this game, ok, so lemme preface by saying that this game is simply OK as it stands.

frankly the most 'game' part of it, is a kinda poor mans space pirate trainer, and feels like it. There are power ups and a few other things that try to give this game its own life, but it feels very derivative of most wave base shooters that VR has to offer.

The reason I am not requesting a refund, is that I am hoping that with the new FPS movement shooter coarse, that the developers are willing to get away from the quick buck of the wave shooter, and evolve the room space VR shooter.

I know that alot of dev's are scared of the movement stuff right now, rightfully so, given how many of my VR adopter friends have had the motion sickness scares, but I think that being afraid of trying these new movement modes, and new gameplay styles is needed to progress into more varied styles of games on this new platform.

I love lightgun games from my youth and this, like many others, scratches that itch that died with the adoption of the flat screen TV, but I really hope that smaller developers are willing to take the risk to try and make some new kinds of shooters in this format and as a community, we can find how to make great room scale FPS games."
Deadlock,513790,62471015,"If your reading this. Go ahead and put this into your cart. It's simple, but polished. Wave shooting, it's a you probably never heard of but you need to get this while its on sale. I would say its as good or even better than titles similar ranging from 5-20$ on the VR steam store. It's similar to Tron but also Riddick. 

I suggest having haptic feedback in a pad and or vest, turn the music off, and this title will bring you into its simulation. 

I like it better than space pirate trainer, call me crazy, but I think when I tried space pirate trainer I was using an older setup occulus dev 2 now im using modified htc vives on super samplings game feels good."
Deadlock,513790,24939580,this game is damn hyphy i like it good price cool tron style graphics totally needs global and friend leaderboards and it will be a regular crack off but without those im afraid people might not play it as much other than that its a killer start man
Deadlock,513790,54492065,"Alright for what I paid for, wasn't expecting anything great but ok for 60 cents. Don't pay full price there are a lot better vr wave shooters out there. I don't recommend unless you pay about a $1.00 or less"
Deadlock,513790,28299642,"Want to experience a cool wave shooter in a tron world for less than ten dollars? Buy it!  Way cheaper than Space Pirate Trainer or Serious Sam, but you don't want to feel like you overpaid for a wave shooter.  This game fits the price."
Deadlock,513790,39303136,"This is one of the better wave shooters I've played in VR. Visually it's a stunning game and has a very retro feel to it. One of my few complaints is the direction the enemies will run and shoot at you. From the sides. It makes it a little difficult to defend one from the other, even with the sheild but I suppose with a little practice and and knowing where the enemies actually are, you could improve. Personally I wouldn't have them run up so far. But you don't have to take MY word for it...

Another thing are the big dogs that run up to you and suddenly jump at you... The only thing that's really detouring me from playing the game more.... but that moreso me being a little b**ch."
Deadlock,513790,28805885,"This is just another wave shooter. I didn't notice any flaws in it when my wife was playing. The graphics style is nice but still I did not notice anything innovative with this one. If you love wave shooters I don't see why you would not like this one. Enjoy.

The Bazaar,455230,22117137,"A dead-simple made-for-VR game. Line-of-sight based controls. You need to be able to rotate all the way around in your seat (a swiveling desk chair is perfect).

I played on a DK2 w/ GeForce 970. The game was fairly comfortable; I felt a bit motion sick after 20 minutes of playing and decided to stop, but most games that involve player-controlled movement make me severely motion sick much sooner so that's pretty good.

Not particularly exciting or even fun, but there are not many VR experiences on the market right now, and I wanted a simple game I could show to my family, etc. without making them motion sick. This mostly fits the bill."
The Bazaar,455230,23817533,"Great game, replayable and very unique. Definitely one of the better experiences ive had with VR. This is one of those games that you get into and are blown away by the art style. Well done. The only thing i'd change is when you turn on the magic carpet your character doesnt turn with it so I found myself spinning in my office chair and getting my cable tangled up. Small issue that would make a big difference. I disliked having to take my headset off to unwrap the cable. Besides that, awesome buy and definitely would reccomend to anyone that wants to experience VR. This is one of those games I'd show off to friends"

The Bazaar,455230,78093172,Great game. I had to abandon the game at the last level because the controls became rubbish. Why not use controllers?
The Bazaar,455230,38017777,"Bazaar different and has a certain charm that won't see from watching the videos or staring at screenshots. As one of the earliest VR titles for Vive, Bazaar has always been on my list to try out. I'm glad I finally went back and bought this game. I think it belongs in everyone's library.

You interact by looking around, but it's not quite as simple as that. You soon forget that's what you're doing as the game draws you in. The game unfolds at a really nice pace: it starts out deceptively simple, but before your know you're collecting and using all kinds of objects and uncovering new aspects to the game you didn't realize were there.

Also, if you have a friend who say they aren't interested in trying out VR, Bazaar might just be the right experience for them. They can sit back and think there's nothing to do, but soon they'll be ""doing"" and interacting without realizing it."

makes me slightly nautious
gets boring quick


the carpet makes some sudden turns and flies diagonally at times which made me nautious
the way the carpet flies back when looking behind yourself and how sudden it stops and starts also made me feel a little uncomfortable
since i have to use my vision center to play the game, i cant look around and enjoy the game, too bad since the artwork is pretty nice
its controlled by looking at something only, which is very slow and limited
you run out of inventory slots quick
some items i have in my inventory suddenly dissappear
when im focusing on an item the carpet sometimes changes directions cause of the path im flying on, which messes up everything and i have to open the menu again
too many items, too few inventory slots
no story... 
levels are very repetitive

It's so simple that even the non-gamer that you just want to show off your VR to would enjoy it. It's got a wonderful color scheme and doesn't encounter (in my opinion) the problem of headaches and motion sickness that you can get from some VR games. It's easy to play if you just want to sit back and play some VR (not having to stand, swivel, etc.) as you control the game with your line of sight and can change your direction with the R1 and L1 buttons on the remote. Very calm while still extremely immersive. It's pretty easy to lose track of time in there!

If you're just going to play one game to demonstrate the awesomeness of VR, this would be my suggestion, easily."
The Bazaar,455230,22898568,"This game is surprisingly very enjoyable, hours more game play than expected! I would suggest sitting down to play, standing up can make you feel a bit sick, but other than that a really solid VR title. I hope the developer will release additional content, or open it up for the community to develop levels/quests.

TL:DR Well worth the money!"
The Bazaar,455230,22634118,"If 'It's a Small World' was a roguelike, it would be this game."
Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,177481549,"People came to this game because it was unique. 

The technology of the time period, 1895, meant that action could only be deliberate and methodical. Speed was not an option. The setting built on the tension. The gentle hum of the wilderness ever present, making the groans, hacking, and wailing of the afflicted creatures dotting the landscape stand out as obstacles to your plans. Not to mention the occasional punctuation of distant gunfire (getting closer?) and panicked sounds of startled wildlife as rival hunters near. You pay close attention to the sounds of your environment with the hope that you will be more prepared for the inevitable clash with your rivals than they will be. Hearing them vault out a window for a noisy shortcut, you follow the faint sounds of their footfalls, raise your 1865 Spencer carbine, look down the sights... 

... and see Ghost Face from the 1996 film ""Scream"". His buddy has been tracking you with his beetle drone and he has led you into his trap, a magical C4 that he sets off with his new sawn-off grenade launcher.

The character of the game is being overwritten to be more like shooters with modern-day settings. The story and setting of ""Hunt"" are being erased. Sometimes even literally. The lore books in the game were entirely deleted earlier this year. 

The most generous I can be to the developers is to say that they must have been having trouble making the money to maintain ""Hunt"" as a thoroughly niche gaming experience. Didn't sustain enough income off the occasional skins to pay for salaries, maintenance, and server fees. So they had to broaden their consumer base somehow, appeal to a larger audience, if they wanted to make a profit for once. They took a lot of cues from ""Call of Duty"". They upped the pace of game-play, cut down the cycle times on guns, and added the kind of high-tech gear you would see in ""Rainbow Six: Siege"" to make the game look more exciting for a younger audience instead of limiting themselves to their small dad-game fan-base. 

But you can't succeed as a live-service game by trying to take an audience away from an existing live-service game. Ask all the ""WoW-killers"" in the graveyard of dead gaming studios how well that plan worked out for them.

This isn't even including the persisting technical issues. For example: lag is still severe and a regular occurrence. At least once every match you are going to have about 10 seconds of standing still waiting for the server to reconnect with you while you hope you don't come back to find your hunter already killed and gone forever.

There is a lot more that can be said, but as someone who has loved this game for years and had confidence that Crytek would pull through in all their challenges, I am just terribly disheartened with the changes made to the world of ""Hunt: Showdown"" this year. I was already feeling like the game I first became fascinated with was changing, trying to be something it wasn't. Still, I was recommending this game just a few months ago. 

Now the Ghost Face trailer dropped. Not only has the pace of the game been changed, but now the character of the game as well. 

I'm out."
Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,178037249,"I uninstalled today. After 1500 hours I uninstalled. The 1896 update has been nothing except a nightmare. I have stuck it out for two months, and consistently the dev team ignores critical issues, and pushes drastic gameplay changes for aspects have existed since the games launch. Change is good, but every change implemented since the update has been founded in the watering down of the things that made this game unique. The game is accessible as ever for new players, but in turn its become shallow. The shark is jumped."
Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,177192331,"I've played this game quite a bit and while it has its ups and downs it is overall a good game. Unfortunately, their most recent large update completely changed the in-between game menus for the worse. I'm not against change and am absolutely in favor of developers updating their game to better align with their vision. This UI update, however, is atrocious. It's extremely annoying to navigate through the menus just to get your character set up, it's not accessible, and it really does take away from the experience. I'm awful at this game, half of my hours have probably been spent setting up a new hunter, so it really sucks to have so many great maps, weapons, enemies, etc. tainted by genuinely the worst UI update I've seen in a game."
Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,178340253,"It's just not worth it anymore.
I used to love this game, as is evident by the hours i've put into it.
But lately, especially since the 1896 update, i just can't enjoy myself anymore.
I fell in love with the game for its gunplay and setting mostly, but in recent matches i just end up bombarded with frag arrows and fire beetles and it just doesn't feel like the more skilled side wins the firefight, but the side that brought more frags and beetles.
In addition i just feel like the decisions by the dev team make no sense in recent months, they nerf all the melee tools, then add the spear that outshined everything, they limet necro to one revive (brilliant decicion imo), but then they add revive bolts? It all just seems contradictary.
I  don't really mind the UI changes, but the plethora of bugs that came with it are atrocious.
I know this rewiew may seem a bit rambly and like I'm just unloading a mental break (maybe I am), just wanted to voice my Opinion.
In conclusion, I want to love this game and in theory it could be so awesome, but in practice it's just not anymore."
Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,177515207,"I've been a hunt player since Jan 2019 until Aug 2024. 1896 update finally convinced me to stop and I no longer can recommend it. This is going to be less of a descriptive intro review and more of an overview of the general approach to development of the game.

Over the years the chosen approach by developers has been shifting from actual development and improvement to monetization and increasingly questionable decisions that undermined the foundation and initial concept of the game - which was the main attraction of it in the first place. The slow-paced high stakes gunplay in a dark atmospheric Wild West setting. I firmly believe that the best hunt times were in 2020 during quickswap meta, however I still think that up until the appearance of the first paid battle pass this was a good game and the devs worked well on improving it. After the first paid event battle pass it's been on a steady decline, getting worse with every update and event. 

1896 has been by far the worst update the game has ever gotten: broken engine with huge amount of various visual issues, increased pc requirements that didn't improve graphics all that much but significantly worsened performance on a lot of systems, hilariously terrible UI that is a much bigger nightmare to navigate than all the previous ones, huge conceptual loss with the removal of most existing 1st-2nd-3d Tier no-name hunters and their general replacement with the paid ones, bullet drop that nobody ever asked for. Ghostface now being by far the worst addition ever, further ruining the concept and immersion of the game. List goes on.

All of that on top of existing issues: non-stop FOMO events that cover more time in the year than the default gameplay but contain most of the (quite bad in terms of diversity and often concept) content behind paid currency, each of them introducing broken traits that devs never fix in the duration of the event, general massive orientation on paid currency that is virtually impossible to get by in-game means thanks to an amazing patch that removed them, constant releases of indentical skin dlcs that add nothing new to the existing game but get increasingly worse in quality - again ghostface is the climax of this issue now. 
Skins are optional but skins are relevant for the immersion and atmosphere, and most importantly they are quite indicative of the general attitude by devs to the game. Somehow we went from fire-themed skins with charity to ghostface.

Gameplay issues is a whole different topic too. Gameplay of the game overall is fine and tolerable but there are many topics that require adjustments: gun balance, spam gun orientation, server quality, connection issues, reconnect feature, hit registration, unpredictable damage, bullet drop, etc. So many things should've been addressed instead of the rebranded release on broken engine.  

It's kinda funny to think about that back in 2019 at the times when at the peak of the day there were 900 people playing hunt on steam it was a much more enjoyable game than it is now, with a community and developers that tried their best to improve it. And we all actually succeeded, Hunt did indeed get popular and better - for a time but not for long. Personally for me the game no longer brings neither the satisfaction, nor the enjoyment. Worst of all is the dev attitude to the game which ruins the concept. Bad concept decisions are much harder to fix than technical issues and unfortunately there's no sign of improvement in this regard. Hunt has never been mainstream and never will be purely because of its concept which is why the veteran community is quite relevant for it. In my opinion the current approach to the game leads to loss of the core part of the community that played the game since the old days. This can be fine too in a way but ultimately I cannot recommend the game anymore for anyone who is attracted to it for the same reason that I was."
Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,178355889,"This WAS my favourite game. 
I gifted it to five different friends and recommended it to everyone who would listen.

I have never felt compelled to review a game before but the sheer disrespect of the playerbase, old and new, has been so egregious that I feel I have to speak up, if only to save a random stranger from wasting their money.

Me and my friends were incredibly excited for the update, but since then its balance, its gameplay and its community have been neglected by Crytek to the point that sometimes it's essentially unplayable.

The bugs are severe and too many to mention.
The cheaters are many and there is no way to combat them at all.
The character of the game is eroding at a rapid pace.
The stability of the game is poor.


I don't have the time or energy to describe how much has gone wrong with it.
It wasn't perfect before, but it WAS fun. The most fun I've ever had with an FPS and perhaps even with any game that I've ever played.

My love of the core makeup of the game is such that I've given it months to be fixed to a reasonably playable state again. The game does look better since the update, but it doesn't matter in the slightest as me and my friends have long since stopped having fun playing it.

This game was designed by talented people who clearly had great passion and were proud of their work and cared. 
It now wreaks of corporate misunderstanding. It is obvious that all decisions are now being made by businessmen who don't play games, don't like games, and don't care at all about their playerbase beyond our ability to fill their pockets.

Any game like Hunt Showdown does, of course, require a steady income stream to stay viable, but it is also only viable if it is enjoyable to play. As it is, I'm lucky to enjoy one out of twenty matches, and I don't even care about winning. My friends and I leave every game frustrated and angry for a myriad of reasons even if we leave with both bounties and have wiped the map of all enemy hunters.

I would have been happy to have contributed a modest monthly subscription to keep the game alive.
As the game is currently. I wish I could have my money back for all of the copies that I've bought.
Unless massive changes happen, it will simply rot in my steam library.

Whoever the new executives are have clearly pumped large sums of money into advertising, which has been effective. The playerbase has expanded massively, but this will not last. There will be a lengthy exodus, but before that happens, the executives will move on to another company, touting their success with Hunt and leaving a dead game in their wake.

This is quite literally not the game that I purchased, and I feel guilty for having clogged my friends libraries with it.

TL;DR

TRASH GAME. TRASH COMPANY 
Don't waste your money purchasing it, or your life trying to squeeze enjoyment out of it.

Pathetic.

Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,178806276,"The state of the game as of Nov 2024 is a complete joke. As someone who has been with the game since early access and have sunk just over 2000 hours into it over the past 5 years, I can't bring myself to recommend this game to anyone in its current state. The relaunch of the game in August was supposed to be a saving grace for this game, but it's felt more like the beginning of a slow death. As of the writing of this review, we are still missing two entire maps that were available to play just a few months ago. I get that they made a really cool map for the relaunch (and it is their best map), but it's crazy that there's less content in the game today than before the relaunch. 

Let's just put aside all of the asinine balancing decisions that the devs have made over the years (since they are completely subjective) and talk about the game purely from a technical perspective. A recurring theme with the game, which seems to have been exacerbated with the migration to the new engine, is the amount of game breaking/experience ruining bugs present within the game at any given time. This game deserved the amount of negativity it received upon relaunch. The fact that there was a bug that would crash your game for opening the map and it somehow made it through testing is absolute insanity. It's a core mechanic of the game. We still have instances of people crashing when entering dark sight (another core mechanic in the game) and sometimes servers will straight up just die mid-match, boot everyone out and reset everyone's progress to the start of the match.

In their most recent update post, Crytek somehow thought it would be a good idea to be candid about how hard game development is and that they may unexpectedly introduce bugs or create alterations to unintended parts of their code base when pushing through updates. This, to me, just shows that the base upon which the game is built is absolute spaghetti code and even the devs don't understand how it works fully. Let's all be completely honest and say that it's not normal for bugs that were fixed years ago to be constantly resurfacing with each update.

A lighthearted joke in the community for the entirety of the game's lifespan has been that when Crytek introduces or alters X item, it indirectly changes Y item's behavior in the game. This was most commonly referenced when players in the community noticed enemy AI and sound trap (horses, crows, ducks, etc) behaviors changing after a random balance patch. This was a meme, but Crytek has basically confirmed that this is exactly what has been happening for the past 5 years and is the reason for why the game never feels like it's in a ""fixed"" state. 

I think the only reason some veterans of the game are still playing is the unique setting/art style of the game. I'd say that the ""aesthetic"" of Hunt is carrying about 70% of this game on its back alone. So kudos to the art team in that regard. If you asked me 3 years ago, I would say that the gunplay is the most important aspect, followed by the amazing sound design, but they've been making a lot of changes to the game that has made it feel less unique compared to other shooters on the market. 

Speaking of sound design, it became objectively worse after the migration to the new engine. It's crazy that they overlooked such an important part of the game, seeing as how they previously won an award for it. Directional audio is screwed right now; it's hard to tell if someone is above, below or directly on top of you. This wasn't the case half a year ago. There are also sound cues that are either not playing properly or not triggering when they should be. Mainly enemy footsteps and throwables being prepped/cooked could just not trigger for you. My guess is that the geometry of the maps is somehow blocking sounds when it shouldn't be. 

Since they basically have drones (beetles), C4 (dark satchels) and Doc's Stim Pistol from R6 Siege (revive bolts), they should probably take another page out of that game's book and carry out their own ""Operation Health"" for a few months to just focus on fixing this broken-ass game. The cynical part of me thinks that they probably couldn't do it even if they poured all their resources into it, either because the engine is awful, their codebase is a mess or the devs are just not competent enough to carry it out. 

TL;DR this game is a technical mess and it's being entirely carried by how unique the gunplay is (or rather, used to be) and its art direction. If a competent competitor were to release a game with a similar aesthetic and gunplay on an engine that isn't complete garbage (yes, I know it's vitriolic, but there's a reason you don't see the Cryengine splash screen on successful games), this game would probably die within a year."
Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,177508193,"Let's start with the positives: I used to suggest this game to basically everyone I knew. I absolutely love(d) the setting, the graphics, the feeling of the guns and the entire premise of the game! All in all, this game is a great foundation, but let's get to the cons:
Sadly since the recent engine update, the game has worsened in performance. You can get killed by someone you just killed, up to 1 second after they hit the ground. There are so many pushing issues, all the loving and care the devs have put in the game has been removed. There was tons of lore accessible by playing, which has all been removed.
The game feels very generic since the update. Not gameplay wise, but UI and handling wise. It just lost all of its charm.

Now on top of those glaring issues, a new DLC has been announced, which absolutely doesn't fit into the game. The skin per se is not bad, it just doesn't fit in all the worldbuilding that has been done prior and seems like a lazy cash grab.

It hurts me to see one of my favourite games, if not my favourite game, spiral downwards into any generic game, loosing all of its charm and ignoring major gameplay bugs and issues."
Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,177374770,"Despite recent controversies and persisting issues, it's still a totally unique and amazing game.

I'm not a big fan of shooters, especially extraction shooters where you lose progress if you're killed on top of being defeated, but this game is much more than just a shooter, which I especially love. At least in my low MMR, even weird strategies are viable if executed right, and you're free to choose what's fun for you.

Top it off with a unique occult Wild West setting, stunning visuals, and crisp general art direction (with a new banger from Port Sulphur Band coming hot each season), and you get a game that will hook you even despite the bugs, ancient servers, and questionable UI.

More specifically, pros:

- Amazing visuals, art, and music. Overall design and art direction are on another level compared to other games of the same genre.
- Great sound design; often you rely more on sound than sight.
- Non-predatory battle passes with great content; can be completed without much grind. Rewards incentivize trying out new loadouts.
- Frequent events done in the style of the game, not as a simple cash grab; moreover, events aren't just cosmetics but add new experimental gameplay elements, which is fun.
- Extremely well-designed maps; each run you become more familiar with locations and can play better, but still find new things to learn.
- Very crisp animations and weapon design; I'm addicted to inspecting Throwing Knives.
- Good balance of PvE vs PvP: there aren't just zombies and stronger zombies, but different enemies whose abilities, AIs, and other features determine how you approach them with different loadouts and compositions.
- Extreme level of detail: muzzle velocity, dropoff range, status effect ranges, different statuses, clearing status drops the sticky/chaos bombs attached to you... simply learning this game will take a solid hundred hours, perhaps hundreds.
- Regular updates: the core concept of the game stays the same, but it's great to see new things being added. My favorite updates are Pact Traits tied to events and new maps/weather conditions.
- Proximity voice chat: while rarely relevant, sometimes allows for hilarious interactions.

And some cons:

- Bugs. They don't happen often (for me), but when they do, it's extremely frustrating as dying to a bug can invalidate 30 minutes of careful gameplay and kill off a hunter you've invested time into.
- UI issues: in-game mouse, wrong numeration of skins, incorrect blood bond acquisition, several summary pop-ups... I like the new look of the UI, but its functionality is far from perfect.
- Server issues: 800ms trade window too often results in being killed through a wall or by someone you haven't even seen yet. Extremely frustrating.
- Lack of replays/death cams: A game with such depth simply calls for a death cam or a whole-match replay; it would be very interesting and valuable to see how the fights actually happened and compare it to your perception.
- ""Skin""/Hunter implementation: overall Hunter designs are extremely great... and yet 90% of the time you're just staring at their hands. It would be great if they had more ""presence"": perhaps custom voiceovers for different hunters, or conditional things to say, include a victory screen where Hunters can be seen... something in this regard. Getting a Hunter skin for 1200 BB and just seeing the hands most of the time is a bit disappointing. But still worth it.
- Matchmaking: I'm on the lower end of MMR, but matches are still extremely imbalanced. Getting matched with 5* players as a 3* with 1-2* friends is just not fun.

I'm glad to have finally found this game; so far it's been an amazing experience."
Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,177222239,"I want to preface this review by saying that I waited two months before posting it, giving the developers time to fix the issues I describe here. Unfortunately, they haven't, so I’m posting it now.

I used to love this game. After buying it in June 2021, I played it for over eight hours a day for the next two months. Even after that, I continued playing it regularly for the past three years. However, after the latest update, the game has become unplayable for me.

The new menus look awful and are unintuitive to navigate (they were clearly designed for consoles, disregarding the PC player base). The UI is broken—skin icons don’t match the skins themselves anymore. Additionally, skins now have different rarities, similar to Diablo or Fortnite, whereas previously, they were all simply labeled as ""legendary."" 

Another aspect that detracts from the experience is the change in weapon naming conventions. Previously, guns used a naming system that made them easy to identify, enhancing immersion. For instance, the Caldwell Conversion Uppercut clearly indicated that it was a model in the Caldwell-made Conversion pistol series, with ""Uppercut"" as the model name. It wasn’t 100% realistic, but it added to the game's atmosphere. Now, the weapon is simply called “Uppercut,” which feels out of place, as if it's from Apex Legends or Fortnite, and it breaks immersion. However, those are relatively minor issues compared to the bigger problems related to gameplay and performance.

Starting with gameplay, bullets now have a drop-off curve in addition to the old muzzle velocity, making it even harder to land hits and headshots over long distances. This change has effectively divided players into two groups: noobs like me, who only land a headshot by pure luck, and expert players who can hit your head behind a sheet of metal and a house from two compounds away. The middle group, to which I used to belong—players who could reliably headshot a stationary or straight-moving target—has now all but disappeared. These gameplay changes, along with others like the introduction of revive bolts for the hand crossbow and new shorter, faster-paced game modes for the current event, make me question the game’s identity. Is it still the slow and methodical extraction shooter I fell in love with, or just another Tarkov wannabe?

All of this aside, you can't even play the game nowadays, thanks to the new game engine, which made the graphics marginally prettier by 0.01% but reduced stability by 99%. I don’t have a weak setup (RTX 3060 Ti, 32 GB RAM, and a fast SSD); the game used to run at a stable 60 FPS on the highest settings. Now, it stutters even on the lowest settings. I can’t recommend playing this game in its current state. Wait until Crytek resolves the pressing performance and UI issues, and then decide for yourself.

In my opinion, the best thing Crytek could do is to revert the game to its state before August 2024, but I’m afraid the road they’ve taken is one of no return. As such, I think it’s time for me to bid farewell to my once favourite multiplayer game."
Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,177559501,"They don't seem to be listening to the community anymore and instead selling out for quick bucks. I don't think its the entire dev teams fault but they have to change course or else this game is going down the tube. Releasing a new UI that was absolutely horrendous is one thing but now spitting in the face of your loyal community by adding novelty character skins and selling out instead of fixing the bugs is taking it too far. As a long time player I will be uninstalling until I see things moving in the right direction, what an absolute joke."
Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,178827627,"more than 3k hours

Overall it's a very good and unique game, I love it and didn't expect to love him that much.

The problem is that it's run by a company that take only weird and bad decision since 2-3 years, game is full of bug, server are trash, chinese invade our server etc. And they don't do anything to fix that, they are busy doing skin and whatever they are doing, who knows

I won't talk about many aspect coz whatever most people are clueless about some fact, like RNG, camping, toxicit, matchmaking, mmr etc...

Love this game, and Crytek SHOULD BE THANKSFULL to have a community like that, the way they handle things is a shame and a disrespect toward their player.

If you fall in love with the game, you might play it a lot, if not you will just laugh at it and never touch it again, imo. And Crytek can only blame themself"
Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,177833542,"I've loved this game since it's conception and have enjoyed countless hours with friends and cowboys alike. So it really breaks my heart to leave a negative review but I can't support the direction the game has taken. The devs have always been very responsive and interactive with the community but lately it seems there has been a growing disconnect with its base. The UI overhaul and seemingly rushed launch of the 1896 has shown gaps in their usually quality work. Not only that, but a commitment to involving real world IPs, more bugs than solutions these days and while the game engine overhaul has brought a new pleasing scenic look to the game, it just has not felt the same as before. Lastly removing the beloved tiered hunter skins was a confusing choice. As much appreciation I have for this game and it's evolution over the years I don't feel I can recommend it in it's current state. I will change my review to positive once I see some improvement."
Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,177505449,"We already have numerous masked hunters.
I understand your attempts at easy monetisation through the least offensive way possible, but you got your response - no thanks.
Do another 'CrossOver™' like this and I'll uninstall the game, simple as. 
"
Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,177609297,"I used to love this game - it's in my top 5 most played. But after the recent soft relaunch, sheer amount of bugs, and now [b]adding lame IPs (Ghostface?!) as a shameless money grab?[/b] What happened? This game is supposed to be a 19th-century extraction horror. The brilliance of this game was how atmospheric it was. One of the things I loved about this game was that, after nearly 500 hours, I was [i]still[/i] getting jumpscared.
I'm disgusted that the devs are stooping to Fortn*te-level crossover events.

[h2]No, I do not recommend this game, and (unless things change) I doubt I ever will[/h2]"
Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,177481587,"If you're seeing this now, you've already missed the golden age of Hunt.

The dev's seem dead set on turning this game into COD, and ruining everything that made it unique. While we're inundated new weapon variants and ammo types that totally defeat the asymmetry that made the game so fun, critical bugs are being ignored and new horrible design choices are being implemented at lightning quick pace.

I do not recommend."
Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,178563193,"I used to love this game dearly, easily one of my GOTO games when i wanted to play games.. but todays players, jeesus, just cowards and boring matches, glitches etc, i dont know what happened, but event is the only thing keeping me playing this game as for now :/ 

might change my mind when i see more stability."
Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,177214347,Every single update they make this game more and more against what it was and it just isn't fun anymore.
Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,177350462,"Game used to be a blast, then Crytek decided its playerbase wasn't important and added AVX2 mandatory support and now I suddenly can't play the game i bought and have supported for over a year now. Feels like a slap in the face, and is really aggravating. Don't put yourself in the situation i put my self in and just play something else."
Hunt: Showdown 1896,594650,177442429,"They patch the game, but break it every time. Then they refuse to patch it during events. They put in predatory advertisements for skins in the loadout menu (they changed that a little but it's still there). Recently they've been plastering the same paint job on a bunch of items and calling it a theme. Trades are abysmal, but working as designed. Region lock is non existent and people from around the world play on distant servers for temporary invincibility. 

I only criticize because I love this game and want it to be better."
Resident Evil 4,2050650,177421608,"I played through the original from 2005 about 7 times on the highest difficulty level.

The new title is called a remake, but many areas have been changed and familiar bosses and enemies have been used in other places, you can like that, but you don't have to. There are also one or two new settings, so some things are new and make you want to play through, that's how it should be.

The graphics and atmosphere are really very well done, in my opinion the best part of the whole series. The light and shadow effects are really impressive. The new missions like medallion shooting are also fun, which was great in the original.

The game itself has become harder, in some places it has a bit of a Dark Souls feel, because you just die without warning or enemies that used to come slowly (Regenerador) now come crawling and jump at you, the traps are also much better laid and the game sometimes turns into work. You are also no longer invincible when you perform combat animations, many enemies no longer stop when you shoot at them and absorb many shots like a sponge. Killing enemies from behind without being noticed is a nice feature.

You can no longer kick doors in either and ammunition (if you get it) is used up again straight away because the areas are just packed with enemies, it sometimes feels like Killing Floor. You are constantly crafting ammunition and shooting.

To be completely honest, when it comes to graphics, sound and atmosphere then it is definitely Resident Evil 4 Remake, but when it comes to authentic areas, nice speed runs or relaxed gaming then definitely the original. I see the remake more as a parallel game to the original. I like them both.

Now for the negative point, what I didn't like so much: In the original, the Separate Ways expansion was included for free, in the remake you have to shell out extra money for it, and 2 weapons or costumes that aren't available in the game can only be obtained via microtransactions, so here again they want to really cash in and milk the player. Keyword: Fear of missing out (FOMO). And then there are special suitcases or talismans that make the game easier because you get more resources, money or buy special upgrades. Microtransactions in a single-player game? I think that's really stupid.

I only got the main game + Separate Ways and it was worth it."
Resident Evil 4,2050650,177799416,"First time I play RE4 was when I was around 14-16 and still in high school. I couldn't play it all the way through because I didn't have a console and instead I would go during the weekends to a friend's house and play for a little bit but never the entire thing. I also played a bit of it when the game came out in Apple Stores, again thanks to a friend who had an iPod. 

I thought maybe I should try this game out now that I can although I didn't think I'd enjoy it as much... boy was I wrong. Played on hardcore on the first playthrough and I was just amazed and mesmerized by everything, from the gameplay to the visuals of the game. There are definitely some stuff from the original that are hard to replicate nowadays but it's still a game you must experience at least once in your life. Loved every aspect of it from start to end! "
Resident Evil 4,2050650,177948319,"I'd almost call this a perfect remake, the modernized combat is extremely satisfying and the game looks gorgeous. My only nitpick is some voice lines missing from the original as well as cut scenes from the original as well. The new direction works incredibly well though and i can see why they did it to create a more similar vibe to the newer installments in the franchise. But it did kinda hurt seeing some of those goofy moments from the original not be in the remake. Still insanely good game and definitely deserves to be recommended."
Resident Evil 4,2050650,178187552,"Obviously this game is great, but fair warning, hardcore mode is no joke. They tell experienced players to go for it, and you'll get through it, but probably take twice as long doing it. Or maybe you're more skilled than me lol!"
Resident Evil 4,2050650,177924903,"completely captures the soul of original RE4, heck it even improves it. Knife rework is by far the best thing, its like the krauser QTE fight from original but you can use it throughout the game + parry.

Really loved the in-game challenges ( some of which are achievements) . Where other games want you to collect 2000 items or do mindless grind for some reward, RE wants you to show your skills."
Resident Evil 4,2050650,178747830,"tell you what, could play only on free weekends and its 19 hours already. This game slaps hard. Im old chad RE 4 enjoyer myself and this game did every bit of it even better"
Resident Evil 4,2050650,177265271,"This has gotta be the best and the most enjoyable remake I played. The game play feels smooth gun play was fun but the Parry and Kicks are satisfying to watch, the story was great and had a few changes from the original but still a great story and the Merchant with his collection of guns and his shooting range really made the game fun as it was.  

I could see that Cap-Com put so much heart when developing this remake since the original is considered the Greatest Resident Evil game from Fans and I couldn't agree more 

Overall I recommend this game to anyone and even new comers if you are looking for a satisfying survival horror gameplay"
Resident Evil 4,2050650,178214330,"Frustratingly difficult. I played the original RE4 and while it wasn't easy, it wasn't ridiculously hard either."
Resident Evil 4,2050650,177727603,this is a solid remake that serves to coexist with its original game rather than try to replace it and is great if you want to  experience RE4 again in a fresh new way. however i cannot recommend it on PC because it has fucking 4 DRMs running at once and crashes every few minutes for me when it used to run flawlessly before they were added
Resident Evil 4,2050650,178433062,"They improved on the original in a lot of ways. Although the last few chapters do feel a bit drawn out. However the added difficulty modes and a new game + mode make this even more replayable than the original. Good stuff :) 
New Ashley is also finally not completely useless and has more depth this time around."
Resident Evil 4,2050650,178568954,"Don't understand why the hell people like this. 
Contextual dodge tied to 2 different buttons instead of a dedicated one, terrible design.
Your knife breaks....just why?
A long escort quest with an npcs that constantly kills itself.
And the flashlight is automatic, meaning you can't decide when to turn it on and off despite it often being ultra dark with Leon refusing to turn it on.

It feels clunky and broken. It's a 5/10 game. Maybe 4/10.
And people compare this to the silent hill remake which plays infinitely better."
Resident Evil 4,2050650,178846811,"Incredible gameplay , optimisation and story. The only con is that the boss fights were too easy some troops were harder and require more resources. Buy the game its worth. Buy VII and 2 Remake too . May play the original after this one."
Resident Evil 4,2050650,178736139,"Купил игру из-за скидок, даже не зная, о чём Resident Evil. И что могу сказать — я безусловно рад, что прошёл вторую и четвёртую части. На самом деле, я давно не получал такого удовольствия от сюжетных игр. Поэтому, если вы не знаете, стоит ли брать игру — однозначно берите! Но перед этим лучше пройти вторую часть. Хотя... лучше пройти всю серию Resident Evil, ведь все части очень интересные."
Resident Evil 4,2050650,178632935,"I waited until I finished it before giving it a final judgment and now I think I can say with certainty that Resident Evil 4 remake is one of the best horror action games ever made. It has an incredible longevity but is never repetitive. The scenarios are different from each other, and also the enemies to face. There is a clear improvement in the combat system that also allows you to kick and block blows with the knife. Against the bosses it is also possible to dodge the blows. The plot is interesting and there are bonus games that allow you to get tokens to buy weapons and to upgrade them. In addition, there are hidden treasures where we can set precious stones in order to increase their price."

Resident Evil 4,2050650,178484744,"Just disappointed over how weird the whole experience felt. For starters, the screen teared like mad and went black when I booted up the game. Updating my hardware didn't help either so I had to google a solution for a game startup in 2024. Managed to adjust settings by forcing windowed mode and setting fixed fps rate  to make it even playable, but my God is it a far cry from the original. If the 2005 release was a bit janky at times, then this is next level. Enemies keep clipping through Leon's model and their melee hitboxes are wider than my dreams, not to mention the controls feel super clunky with  the camera being glued right into the back of Leon's skull, limiting view severely. 

Despite maxing out the aim and general camera sensitivity, it doesn't feel like they're following along properly even on mouse and keyboard. Maybe I'm just getting old, but being forced to parry attacks with a knife in a RE game doesn't feel right, when you have one that is. Mine broke before I cleared the intro scene in village main square and I was left bummed out by the lack of everything by the end of it. I don't see myself playing this ever again, which is a real shame because I enjoyed the old RE4 quite a bit back in the PS2 era, and I was curious on how they'd tackle a classic like this. Guess I was expecting too much after the RE2 remake."
Resident Evil 4,2050650,178310427,it worked until 2 days ago than it keeps crashing. im probley never buying a resident evil game again after this experience i litterly just waisted 20 bucks + tax for something i cant even play and my computer meets min requirements actually above that so its the game not pc and i was getting around 40 fps on medium settings on 1080. now after 4-5 hours of gameplay it just keeps crashing on the louding screen. i dont recommend this game atleast on pc its a waist of money you wont be able to play it save your money for a game that actually works. i even redownlouded the game still does the same thing.... ps those hours is a lie 99 percent of the time i tried to play it but kept crashing realistically i only got about 4-5 hours in the game 10-12 extra hours is from me constantly rebooting the game. now when i actually was able to play it it is a good game but sense it just constantly crash i wouldn't  waist another dollar on any resident evil game again. i was thinking about buying village but now im like hell no because of the constant crashing this game is broken its not a functioning game. fix the game before selling it im so glad i didnt buy it full price this game isnt even worth a dollar because it doesnt  work... i cant recomment a broken game
Resident Evil 4,2050650,178068435,"Another fantastic game by Capcom. This time it's more action packed than anything but it's an experience I thoroughly enjoyed. Gameplay as always is superb and the level design, puzzles and what not are fun.

The gameplay is smooth, and each match feels unique, offering plenty of ways to improve skills like dribbling, shooting, and pulling off aerial moves.

The learning curve is challenging, but it’s so rewarding once you get the hang of it. Whether I'm playing casually with friends or grinding ranked matches, Rocket League delivers thrilling moments every time.

Is it legal for a game to force you to sign a contract to play it after you already purchased it:

(No, it is not legal for a game to force you to sign a contract to play it after you have already purchased it.

This practice would likely violate consumer protection laws in many jurisdictions. Once you have purchased a product, you generally have the right to use it as intended without being subjected to additional conditions that weren't disclosed upfront.

If a game company is attempting to enforce such a contract after the purchase, it's advisable to consult with a legal professional or consumer protection agency in your region. They can provide specific guidance based on your local laws and the circumstances of the situation.)

Rocket League,252950,177173080,game is so fucking trash now. shitty overpriced MTX with no updates to any of the terrible game's network issues. boring recycled game modes no one plays. constantly starting matches when it doesn't have all 6 players and forces you to re queue into matchmaking. Epic ruins games.
Rocket League,252950,178390894,"Possibly one of the most competitively entertaining games out, but and it's a big BUT, the matchmaking is appalling in competitive.

The programmers think they're helping, they are not, PLEASE make this random, it will benefit everyone."
Rocket League,252950,177529234,Ranked play is not it. I recommend going in with a friend because randoms on ranked is terrible. Also game bans you for the tiniest things so do not use voice chat.

Rocket League,252950,178802699,"
I loved this game - could play it for hours. It performed great on the Steamdeck until they removed linux and mac support. RIP Rocket League :("
Rocket League,252950,178677137,it's very good. many customization options ect. non the less good game
Rocket League,252950,178582581,"I've been playing Rocket League since its early days on Xbox (2015-2019) before switching over to PC and I've racked up a solid 8,500 hours across both platforms. As an OG player who managed to snag the game on Steam before it was taken off the platform, I feel lucky to have witnessed Rocket League’s growth from the ground up.

What I’ve always loved about Rocket League is the balance it strikes between being casual fun and a deeply competitive experience. You can play a relaxed game with friends or dive into ranked matches, where every goal, every save, every second counts. It’s thrilling and unpredictable and with the variety of game modes and customisation's, I’m still finding new ways to enjoy it. Nowadays, I’m mainly a casual player, but I’ve had my fair share of accomplishments in ranked play. 

One of my absolute highlights as a Rocket League fan was attending the RLCS Major in Stratford, London, at the start of 2024. Seeing top-tier players in action, meeting others who share the same love for the game and coming away with some exclusive merch—it was a memorable experience that deepened my appreciation for the community behind the game, I would love to attend more or even Worlds in the future.

If you’re looking for a game that combines fast-paced action, skill and community, Rocket League is the one to pick up. Whether you’re here for a laugh with friends or ready to climb the ranks, it’s a game that genuinely has something for everyone.

Rocket League,252950,178420589,"nothing but smurfs, cheaters, hackers, servers are trash, you lag constantly, and the community in the game is all trash talkers, dont bother playing this game at all"
Rocket League,252950,178115762,This game keeps getting worse. They are doing a terrible job lately with the servers this game is almost unplayable at this point. If not for workshop I wouldn't touch it. Someone needs to get in contact with these people and tell them to fix this game.
Rocket League,252950,177935156,"Love this game, I have been playing it since it came out and have actually purchased the game on numerous consoles back when you had to pay for it. Since 2018/2019 this game has been in a slow decline for it's community, starting with the removal of trading and loot boxes/keys. Those are completely unrelated to this review. Within the last year the devs have shown how much they don't care about the community with the servers and gameplay getting worse with every update. Some how they took the good and accurate physics and threw them  out the window. Do you like consistency in your online multiplayer games? Well too bad since this game will never be consistent, prime example the ghost touch that has randomly come from out of no where. Fix the gameplay then work on making the community whole again."
ELDEN RING,1245620,177500219,"Cant remember the last time I could get so lost in a game's world.  Absolutely beautiful.  For those of you like me who enjoy comparing stats on your loot and figuring out the best build for the right situation, this is the pinnacle. 

The ONLY thing I would caution is that if you have a life, kids, etc. this game might suck 600+ hours of your life like it did me.

Thumbs way way up"
ELDEN RING,1245620,177176388,"So after completing the game more than 4 times on Steam and 2 times in seamless coop, I can confidently say this is the best open-world RPG ever made. For me, it was The Witcher 3 holding the title for years, but now we have a new Elden Lord to claim the crown, haha.

The lore in Elden Ring is something else. From the mind of R.R. Martin and direction from Miyazaki, this is not just lore but an experience of its own. From cool to mysterious to dark, every backstory of particular NPCs or bosses is different, making you want to explore more. Since I've completed the game with 100% side quests and main story guidance, it’s pretty easy to get lost in the woods or ruins if you don’t have guidance to chase the lore.

The DLC for Elden Ring is a game-changer. After diving into it, I can say it adds so much to the experience. The new areas are breathtaking, just like the main game, and the fresh challenges and bosses are a blast. The lore gets even richer, pulling you deeper into the world with new stories that make you want to explore every corner. Completing the new quests felt rewarding, like a sweet bonus for all the time I’ve spent in the Lands Between. If you loved the base game, this DLC is an absolute must-play!

Apart from the lore, the combat is challenging yet fun to mess around with, xD. It’s a typical Souls-like game, but here you get a vast open world to explore for new weapons, magic spells, incantations, and many more things to kill the dead. On top of that, every weapon or spell has its own visuals or ambient effects, which look stunning on high graphics—just like a visual novel or something. The graphics are breathtaking; the world is beautifully made and designed. From Limgrave to the nightmare called Caelid, haha, every area feels creepy yet beautiful.

In short, I’d say Elden Ring isn’t just a game; it’s an experience that Miyazaki-sama has done for us. Ngl, even if you’re weak or a pussy, you need to play Elden Ring once in your lifetime. Just like RDR 2, Wukong, The Witcher, and many more, it’s rare to find such a masterpiece these days that respects your time and money invested in games.

10/10 – A fucking masterpiece. Miyazaki GOAT.

ELDEN RING,1245620,177050331,"The sense of mystery and discovery is unmatched. I thought open world games were not for me anymore but i was not at fault for thinking that, it was the uninspired games that other AAA companies keep churning out. One of the best open worlds i have been in. Top tier lore. Amazing characters.True diversity in ways to tackle bosses. Quests feel like a QUEST and not a checklist. Masterpiece!!!"
ELDEN RING,1245620,178565136,"Cute little indie game. There's a few cool hats and a nice horse. You can make friends with several charming characters and you can even farm (souls from fingers on the roots of an eldritch tree within an infernal mist) if you like. Perhaps one of the prettiest games I've played in a long time. Still, I have nightmares about the little men who play brass instruments, and I can never find the sewer. It's quite like Stardew Valley in that they both have a hidden sewer level."
ELDEN RING,1245620,178484142,"I really do think this is one of the best games ever made, and it's only gotten better with time. Is it perfect? No, nothing is. While it has countless flaws, its an absolute masterpiece."
ELDEN RING,1245620,178259328,"Elden Ring is probably the game that I have enjoyed the most in a long, long time, its world building, setting, artistic design and of course, the lore and construction of its characters, the feeling of adventure (me being lost 99% of the time lol), the feeling of ignorance, sometimes even anguish and fear are things I really appreciated about this game. Sadly, it is a game I would like to erase from my memory to play and enjoy it as I did back in the day.

P.S: Where is my Bloodborne on PC, FromSoftware. I played it in 2016 and since then I've wanted to replay it without having to buy a PS4 >:("

ELDEN RING,1245620,177276614,"Amazing Game, really recommended for people who like RPGs or rouge like, you can really play at your own style, and there's plenty of build you can go for, it's a bit challenging but it's soo much fun!"
ELDEN RING,1245620,177257725,"Elden Ring is a masterpiece in modern gaming, merging brilliant gameplay with a vast, immersive world. Its open-world design offers unmatched freedom to explore breathtaking landscapes, filled with hidden secrets and lore. The storytelling is deep and subtle, unraveling through the environment, NPCs, and cryptic item descriptions, creating a rich, never-ending narrative.

However, what truly sets Elden Ring apart is its relentless difficulty. Like other FromSoftware titles, it challenges players with tough enemies and complex combat, demanding precision and patience. Each victory feels earned, adding to the addictive thrill. In summary, Elden Ring is a captivating blend of freedom, challenge, and deep storytelling."
ELDEN RING,1245620,177005241,very fun game with many difficult and rewarding boss fights and a very big and awesome open world

Easily the best FromSoftware game till date!
11/10"
ELDEN RING,1245620,177705224,"I'll start with the negatives (just for fun).  The lore of J.R.R. Martin's work, and it's messy, gory and perverse accordingly.  The construction of the track is catastrophic: getting from A to B is more difficult than driving on my capitol during road renovations.  The mobs are often terribly annoying and you die from them sooner than from the big bosses.  The beginning sucks because of the souls like system. Oh, and it's not a game for the physically challenged.  If only because of the lame parkour system.  I've played parkour games before (AC, Dying Light), but this one?  You want to jump somewhere and you will find it - approx.  In a 10-meter radius around him, something... or nothing and you're did...

 What is the positive in it?
 How amazingly exciting!  Addictive because of the constant dopamine rush.  There is something new around every corner, an enemy, a mystery, a loot, a catacomb, a wonderful sight, a questline, etc.  You can completely depend on it while you play, compared to it (almost) everything else seems gray.  At first you grind to have your build and to survive at all.  Then from a certain point you start to enjoy it because you already have your build and you can win in a row against enemies that you ran away from in the beginning (the Tree Sentinel is an amazing challenge at first, isn't it, and then you can survive Rykard as well).  It feels amazing! 
 Meanwhile, the landscapes sometimes look like a painting or even a nightmare, and even though Torrent has no physics, it's really fun to jump around with him.
 I have to admit, this game does something right.  Moreover, it introduces you to the world of souls like in such a way that you won't lose your interest right away, and even though it doesn't hold your hand, it is full of hidden hints and facilitations even for beginning souls like players (like me).  Not like Lies of Pi, for example, where I never even got past the apprentice boss.  Here, there is not one solution for a fight or an enemy, it depends on you, and not on the perfect parry (which depends on your fps and controller handling), where and how far you get...
 What was missing from the end was the epilogue, at least in pictures.  Because the way I saw it, almost every ending has the same ending, either you sit on the throne or that's it.  But these are only cuts of a few seconds.  Why was it not possible to show in a 1-2 minute animation what kind of change it brings to Lands Between for each ending?  With one, everything blossoms, with the other it falls into obscurity, or everyone is enough, etc.  It would probably have been graphically difficult to solve, since even after the ending you can go back and wander around and everything, but I would have liked a more epic sequence of scenes at the end, especially since everyone puts in 100-200 hours, a longer conclusion would be appropriate.

 PS: for beginners, a good guide (and maybe some help from a friend) is definitely highly recommended, without it you'll die within 5 minutes and really just get frustrated!

 P.S. I finished it in the meantime, and it's a huge bummer, because I never would have thought that about myself!  What about me and soulslike?!  But I did it, and I'm very happy about it!  It will be an eternal experience!"
ELDEN RING,1245620,177954725,Buy game. Spawn. Spend three hours beating horse man to death with starter gear with friends. Get big sword from Guts. Use it the entire game. Win. 10/10 would play through with my mates using a big sword to stun every boss into a corner again.

Heroes of Might and Magic III: The Restoration of Erathia,297000,178229442,"While I consider Heroes of Might & Magic III one of the greatest TBS games of all time, I cannot recommend buying this version. 

This version is missing all of the expansions and lacks quality-of-life features provided by the HD mod, like buying all units from a castle at once or quick stack splitting. Otherwise, it plays exactly like the original game.

It is better to purchase HoMM III Complete Edition on another platform and install the fan-made HD mod. Despite what some people say, it aged very well; in fact, I think it even looks better than some modern games.

Initially, Ubisoft claimed that the source code had been lost. However, even after it was found, they still refused to release the expansion. Shame on you, Ubisoft."

It still holds up extremely well, especially with the 4K treatment, and is quite a bit better than any TBS game out there right now.

-----------------------------------------------
a masterpiece. The gameplay is that perfect mix of strategy and adventure like chess but with dragons, wizards, and a ton of lore to keep you hooked. The game throws you into a world called Erathia, where mythical creatures, heroes, and villains clash for control. Each faction has its own vibe like the undead Necropolis or the mystical Tower, and trust me, you'll feel it when you dive in. The lore? It's deep and dramatic, with rivalries, alliances, and betrayals. Basically, it’s Game of Thrones, but in the 90s.

You build up towns, recruit armies, and explore crazy landscapes, all while getting wrapped up in quests that bring the story to life. Every hero you level up feels epic, like watching your favorite character finally get their big moment. And the HD update? Looks good while keeping that old-school charm intact.

If you’re into strategy, world building, or just want a game with endless replayability, this one’s a legend. Play it, live it, and get ready to lose track of time.

Enjoy the game!"

Enshrouded,1203620,178464328,"    Enshrouded, in short, is almost everything you could want from an RPG/Builder hybrid. It has some of the best building systems i've ever seen. This is where the game really shines. With recent update you even have people and animals to make your towns feel alive. 
   
    The combat is pretty decent. Nothing really new here but that isn't a bad thing in this case. 

    The talent tree is not too deep nor too simple, meaning you probably won't have to research your choices to be effective at what you want to be while also not being able to fill the entire tree making you have to make choices but also forgiving with the ability to reallocate your points. 

     The area where the game still needs the most work is the RPG/Story aspect. The story isn't bad, there just isnt much of it, or lore/history to uncover but the game is still in EA so still time to improve. 

     Character creator is abysmal for 2024. Please devs work on this.

     Though not perfect, Enshrouded is already a great game that gets better every update, a great value even at full price, and an absolute steal when on sale. 8/10 at the time of this review"

Enshrouded,1203620,178316323,"This such an amazing game. The landscape is incredible, the combat is pretty great, not super innovative but still really good, building is awesome, crafting and hunting for resources is really fun too. Lots to do. Pretty indepth game."
Enshrouded,1203620,178740899,"Honestly? 9/10. $30 for this game is fucking insane to me, it's well worth more. Tldr below.

Enshrouded is incredible. Gameplay reminds me of Fable, the 2024 edition, but with crafting. Coming from Valheim and Medieval/Sengoku Dynasty - games I enjoyed but never felt true ""satisfaction"" (always felt like something was missing or overly complex) - Enshrouded checks boxes. Nearly all of them. 

Enshrouded in its initial release form was *Good*. Now, it is *powerfully* good. I am a survival crafting noob, I dont buy into hardcore survival sims that require extensive wiki's and google docs to figure out basic recipes and how to avoid starvation. Enshrouded figured itself out, the formula just works whether you're hardcore or casual. 

With the recent additions in November 2024, adding an insanely MASSIVE zone to the already massive map and QOL updates as well as aesthetic bonuses, the only thing selling this game short is its lack of Medieval Dynasty's town NPC population and lack of guidance regarding how to acquire some recipes. There are numerous difficulty options to cater your experience towards combat focused or crafting focused. Venture into a cave and only face 1 or 2 enemies (or none at all) - or dial it up and face 50 with extra health/dmg/etc.

Finish your first adventure, return home and build the ugliest or coziest mansion on a giant property of your choice. I opted to increase gathering yield so I can hop into building faster, with slightly harder enemies in higher counts - it's perfect. You can build and craft *anywhere* - and the intuitive creative nature of the building system is top notch. Items meld and morph into each other, creating new shapes and structures you couldn't do by default. The game encourages experimentation, build a Lord of the Rings castle or an old school Japanese mansion or both. Among *many many many* other styles. 

The combat is simple enough, but more in depth than Valheim by far. The skill tree is a simplified version of PoE. Battlemage, Tank, Ranger, Paladin, among many other styles. 

It also has the potential to play on a potato based on my past experience with the initial release version. I've since upgraded and the game is gorgeous at max quality. I just sat atop a mountain and played music for half an hour for no reason at all than the satisfying aesthetic. 

My complaint: home bases feel slightly too empty. Many of us were looking forward to the ""Townsfolk"" update, assuming we would be able to populate our home bases with commoners/villagers etc. It's the reason I initially quit. I loved crafting and fighting, but I felt alone. Then the Nov 2024 update for Townsfolk turned out to be just an addition to the *crafter* NPCs you can place in your base. Unlike Medieval/Sengoku Dynasty, where your village can have 50+ commoners roaming about, doing jobs, hanging out, etc.

Tldr: Beautiful game, insane amount of content, express your inner adventurer or crafter. Devs care. 10x better than it was at release. Home bases still feel a little lonely, Townsfolk update wasn't what many of us expected. Still, more than worth the price, I wouldve gladly paid $60+."
Enshrouded,1203620,178434462,"Loving this game, the mix of building exploring resource gathering is excellent and the storage amounts are good which means inventory issues are not a huge problem and love the magical chests!, the ability to multiplay aspect works well and love the fact that you share completion on bits if one of you find certain items you all do.  The puzzles are good fun and well thought out I play alot with my hubby his only complaint is there is a lot of height in the game and at times it sets his vertigo off but we manage I on the other hand love it!.  As I said I love the game its a bit like minecraft for grownups with all its aspects but with a brilliant storyline to follow.  Recommend to anyone would love it if the shroud could dissipate if your flame covered the area but a[art from that excellent!"

I stopped playing for a bit to let them get more content out, and am back now that they adding husbandry!"
Enshrouded,1203620,178545232,Came back for the update and i don't know what they did but the performances are atrocious.
Enshrouded,1203620,178552102,"Devs communication is 10/10. Game updates frequently towards the player feedback.
The game feels like if budget Zelda: BoTW met with Valheim; meaning it's action RPG with crafting and base building. Core gameplay is exploring the world, finding NPCs, recieving quests from them and building a base. Don't expect much from the ""Survival"" label, the game is focused more on the RPG side than the survival one.

Exploration is the best, the game rewards you for every bit of curiosity.
Combat is okay (not great, not terrible).
Base building provides you huge freedom which is a bit overwhelming, but if you get into it you can build some crazy, detailed and (possibly) beautiful stuff.
There is some story provided by the NPCs or by books; not the main focus of the game but it's decent when you take your time and read some of those.

There are, however, some bad things; bugs, optimalization issues, weird item/skill description.. But the game is keep changing and things are getting fixed or updated.

I used to experience lots of crashes but I fixed it by turning OFF the V-Sync and lowering most of the graphical settings from high to medium. Since then the game runs smoothly.

Overall I really enjoy this game playing either alone or with friend."
Enshrouded,1203620,178827282,"I've played this game long enough to know it deserves a review. It's a beautiful open world game with a good variety of enemies, challenging combat (it offers different levels of difficulty too), a great level of customization in home building, a complex tree of abilities to suit your play style or even your groups play style. I play this game with my boyfriend, and we both love exploring and adventuring across the land. He plays a wizard character while I focus more on dexterity and daggers. 
I would also like to congradulate the team on their newest expansion. An expansion they gave to their players for free, for the love of the game. I haven't finished exploring the new biome yet, but we've been working hard on it. We have the new sets of gear, a bustling farm, and two new pets in our tavern we call home.  It's an amazing game that has something for everyone, and its developed by a team that genuinely loves their game and cares about the feed back their players give them."
Enshrouded,1203620,177559946,"Low key was enjoying the game when it came out. Decided to go full sweat mode (bad idea) and build a nice enough house for myself. Stored all my top gear stuff in a chest, come back after 8 hours of torture just for my chest to de-spawn and lose everything, and i mean EVERY POSSIBLE THING! Fuck this game."
Enshrouded,1203620,178595381,"This game is everything I look for in a Survival crafting game.
Well, first of all, it's not really survival, as ""survival"" isn't the goal.
It's more of an open world RPG with a lot of typical ""survival crafting game"" elements. Like base building, food, crafting, etc, but with RPG mechanics, quests, levels, items and more.
What this game does very well :
Best building system of any game in my opinion. You can create so much, it's my favorite part of the game.
Exploration is cool, the map is beautiful and varied.
The gameplay loot. Crafting, building, fighting, leveling, looting, travelling, everything is well done.
What this game does well : 
Combat is fine,
 level system is fine,
 inventory system is fine. 
I hope they make it even better in the future, because it's a bit lacking but still satisfactory, for what the game is.
There's plenty of content, and in less than a year they added a bunch.
What this game does badly : Performances. Nothing crazy, but it could use optimisation for sure.

Enshrouded,1203620,178604350,"One of the best games I've ever played and one of my favorites. Great building system, excellent exploration mechanics, very good crafting, cool atmosphere and lore, and solid RPG elements with boss fights (especially the new fire dragon). The only thing that needs improvement is optimization.

As for the developers, if every studio and developer had this approach, we’d only have great games. Amazing communication with the community and excellent updates. ❤️

Highly recommended!"
Enshrouded,1203620,178599121,I'm going to rate this down because they didn't exactly nail the camera motions with this. I easily become nauseous and motion sick while playing and had to refund. Hopefully the devs can get someone to do some decent camera work in the future. Really wanted to play this one....
Enshrouded,1203620,178806746,"I would love this game even more if if the world wasn't coated in butter and you slip and slide like its a water park on all the surfaces. I wanna be enshrouded not in a slip n slide.

PLZ FIX BOSS"
Enshrouded,1203620,178797437,One of the best survival/crafting games out. Rivals Valheim imo. The building in this game is just incredible once you figure out the nuances. The developers are constantly adding fantastic updates. I can't recommend this game enough.
Enshrouded,1203620,178388474,"The gameplay is fun, and the world is fantastic, but there are too many problems with the game for me to enjoy it at this point.
I have a 4070ti and a ryzen 5800x, 32GB of ram and the map is laggy to the point of crashing my game most times when i use it, and you use the map for travel...
It has been like this since it came out and they don't seem to care."
Enshrouded,1203620,178807050,"This is easily the worst open-world survival-craft game I've played. The ""open world"" part is correct, but neither the ""survival"" or ""craft"" part is. This is closer to a Breath Of The Wild retelling from a studio who never played Breath Of The Wild, but rather, heard their big brother talk about it.

It has Conan Exiles' combat system, but without the variety of weapons, heavy attacks, or combat options. Magic is only damage and heals, so it's rather dull and painful to play with. Projectiles are slow enough to make it hard as hell to hit a moving target, and wands just about can't hit anything at all. The game's auto-targeting is worthy of memes, where hitting the enemy you want to hit (or an explosive barrel) is the hardest part of the game.

The crafting system is atrocious. You can't craft much of anything that has a purpose, and new crafts come slowly. The gear you can craft falls way behind what you'll find in the world--and there isn't any variety in the gear that you can craft. I hope you want a low-level sword or a fire wand, or low-level leather armor, because that's all you're getting for the first 31 hours.

Minecraft has a wider selection of potions. The cooking system is Valheim's, but dumbed down so much that you can completely ignore it and not notice a difference--aside from water that regens your stamina or berries that regen your health. I don't know how the farming system is, because in my 31 hours I never needed it. All of your food items will come from the world as you explore or fight, and you're going to have more food than you'll ever need.

The way you get new gear is horrible. Like I said above, you don't craft your gear. Rather, you find it in the world. Enemies drop some slight upgrades, or you farm glowing chests for serious upgrades. Here's how you upgrade you gear: you explore until you find a golden chest. Then you build a spawn point next to it, loot the chest, quit the game, log back in, and loot the chest again. Do that for an hour until all your gear is awesome. After you gain some levels, find a golden chest in a higher-level area and do it all over again. Your'e not crafting shite.

I've heard that the building system is just about best-in-class, but after 31 hours, I haven't built a single structure. There's no need to, except for ""it's fun and that's what I want to do."" The world is littered with prebuilt structures, which include a whole lot of villages and mansions. Most people just take over one of these. And with the way that bases work, you have no need to ever build outposts or a second base. You build one base, and your others are just fast-travel points. I'm really big into base-building, but I just had zero desire to do it here. There's no need to, since everything is just given to you.

The game is easy. Death is meaningless, and is barely an inconvenience. A lot of places have respawn points right outside the hard fights, so you can freely face-roll the hard fights while standing on a pile of your own corpses. Even though the game is generally easy, the combat is so bad that it makes things hard when you're facing more than one opponent. You just don't have shite for combat options. You can swing your sword and hit every enemy around you, or you can shoot a couple of fireballs out of your staff before you're out of mana, or you can use any other option and hit one guy at a time. Blocking and parrying is only meant for one-on-one encounters, and blocking more than one dude quickly burns all your stamina or gets you stunned. If you're a mage or archer, all that dodge-rolling you're going to do will burn your stamina even faster. Again, you have no options except for ""attack"", ""spend a large chunk of stamina to roll away from one attack,"" ""spend all of your mana to kill two guys with fireballs,"" or ""fail at parrying because you'll never get used to parrying something that isn't attacking.""

You have a grappling hook, which sounded really cool, but you can only use it on a handful of certain points in the world. It isn't free to use anywhere. There's an upgrade in your skill tree that lets you use it to pull flying enemies to the ground, which is nice. If the grappling hook were removed from the game in the next patch, no one would notice.

I wish I could get a refund, but it's a bit late for that. To be fair, I had fun while I was getting the hang of the game. Once I got the hang of it, I spent 20 hours trying to force myself to play it, so as to justify the money I spent on it. The map is huge and I've only explored a third of it, but I have no desire to see what the rest of it looks like. You'd only explore it to see what it looks like, because nothing you're going to do in that area is enjoyable."
Crusader Kings III,1158310,177848922,"It's a good game but, at the moment, it's not worth playing unless you own all the dlc's. For example, the grandeur court mecanic, unintenional or not, is locked behind the dlc but it still gives minus opinion to all you vassals, despite not owning the DLC. Not sure it is a bug or it was left on purpose to force people to buy the dlc, as it makes playing as empires almost impossible. Until it is resolved, i do not recomend buying."
Crusader Kings III,1158310,178105209,"I always enjoyed this game, defintely well made. The studio did great.

BUT

They're releasing too many DLC and they sell them for like 10€ the cheapest, some are at 30€...
I paid my game 60€ and i bought 50€ worth of DLC already last year. I realised today that if i want to play the full game i'd have to pay 70€ more for DLCs adding mecanics and cultures PLUS another full 70€ for a full cosmetic pack.

The game already costs 180€ + 70€ of cosmetic detailing cultures even more.

It's way too much, most of us are not insanely rich in a world where everything costs more and more. We can't follow such a greedy market anymore.

This sole fact deserves a negative review imo."
Crusader Kings III,1158310,178423099,"This game is complex to learn, but highly addictive and fun. Once you think you have an understanding of it, a new event or random circumstances throws your gameplay out the window. Best to treat it as a role playing game and not to focus on one character. Go with the flow and enjoy."
Crusader Kings III,1158310,178504309,"I am going to recommend not buying this game after putting hundreds of hours into it and buying all the DLC. The main game loop is empty, the AI is brain-dead whether it comes to the combat AI or the character AI. Characters have personality but there is no link to character actions. The game has an excess reliance on RNG and events. There is a shallow shell of a emergent story that you might think the game is feeding to you but the characters are not rooted in any persistent relationship.

You might go on a pilgrimage to a holy site and meet different characters. Rather than meet fellow lords who might be zealous however, you will meet disposable one-time-only characters. 

This is what I mean by CK3 being overly reliant on RNG, the game has interesting mechanics but does not integrate any of them in a deep or meaningful way. The surface of the game looks interesting but the inside is completely hollow.

The only reason you might want to play the game is the excellent mods. After years of playing this game, I still can't recommend this game because all of the mods are built on a game that is half-baked.

And oh god, the bugs refuse to get patched out."

Crusader Kings III,1158310,178446558,"This game is really fun if your willing to learn the mechanics and such. I've played for quite a bit and I still don't quite understand the game, yet it's extremely fun regardless. 

So why do I not recommend it?

Well, because despite how fun it is, you can't really enjoy a game when it...you know, doesn't open or closes upon menu screen. 

Ever since I bought this game, its worked fine. I played unmodded for a good while, worked perfect. I played with mods for a good while, still worked perfectly.

However, for some reason, the most recent update has made it LITERALLY impossible to play the game. I can't open the game because after its done loading into the menu screen, it just crashes. 

Ok, maybe its just my Elder Kings 3 mod or one of my other ones. I uninstall all of my mods. Its now completely unmodded, just the base, vanilla game. So, it should work, right?

Nope.

Sucks. I've absolutely loved this game since I began playing it. And now im completely barred from being able to play it. 

I've verified my files. I've uninstalled my mods. I've tried countless different solutions I've found on the internet and not a single thing has fixed it. 

The fact that ONE SINGLE update fucked up my entire game is just baffling. Admittedly, im not sure if im the only one with this issue or if this is a common thing amongst everyone else, so take my recommendation with a grain of salt. Maybe the game will work for you!! 

Its the fact that I have to say ""Maybe the game will work for you"" at ALL is whats making me write this review."

Why do you even advertise that this game works on macOS if this is not true? This game on macos is completely unplayable an buggy, and I saw on reddit that these issues persist over years, yet the ck3 developers don't do anything to tackle these issues. 

The newest version is extremely buggy playing on macOS Seqoia. The complete user face is buggy. Almost 70% of all user interface in the game is invisible or bugs out. if you really try to play it, you have to guess where what is because it is invisible or bugs out.

To get a functional gameplay experience (after updates introduced mechanics like legitimacy that apparently can only properly be dealt with via Dlc content) you would have to spend upwards of 150,- EUR, which is simply insane to me.

Fighting Games aren't the same entity I fell in love with. I fell in love with a genre that held a community of people who enjoyed testing themselves and improving. No matter how ""cheap"" a character was, you could always develop ways to beat said character through labbing. 

Modern day Fighting Games aren't about testing yourself. Its about getting as many newcomers as possible and about selling DLC characters. I thought adding Battle Passes would get rid of the need for overly strong DLC characters but they persist.

I'm tired.

The most fun I have in modern fighting games are in training mode, practicing combos or discovering new tech. Unfortunately, it all seems helpless to the looming threat of new DLC characters making everything I've practices completely useless. The constant updates and lopsided balancing doesn't help either.

After over a year and hours of building up my avatar in World Tour mode, I had 1 save corruption and lost all of it.  There is no backup or restore option so everything is just gone like that.

As a casual player, I've only reached level 15 after 10 hours of gameplay. I got curious and looked up an experience guide. Apparently, it’s possible to unlock all equipment (around level 100) with about 5 hours of intense XP farming. This wasn't an issue in the previous version of the game. I'd enjoy this way more if they reduced the grind."
Phasmophobia,739630,178060957,"great game, but with the new EULA privacy policy, just as a TL;DR, it can:
access your ram to see if any unauthorised programs are open.
take away any dlc, or the game its self without a refund.
monitor your ""actions"" in game, (what you say, how you play the game, what you read, do, ect)
as well as the basic (your stupidity in vr, if you get scared, ect isnt on us) 
not a huge fan of the fact it monitors and collects data"
Phasmophobia,739630,177669974,"I bought this game on the early access release and loved it, didn't play it all the time but always went back to it. however with some of the ""recent"" updates they purged all the players levels and locked all the gear behind a really steep XP grind that frankly just isn't worth it. I shouldn't have to spend hours grinding just to play a game I have over 50 hours in at a basic level, once again developers ruining a decent game with shitty updates. in it's current state I wouldn't recommend ANY new players get into it it's just not worth it."
Phasmophobia,739630,177271748,"Really fun, might seem repetitive but not as long as you are with friends. The cooperative puzzle solving nature is really engaging. Eventually you unlock more sophisticated items, and get more skilled, but the game has higher difficulties for you to scale on. One of the best party games out there."
Phasmophobia,739630,177945817,"This game use to be casual fun. I took a break and came back to it. Picked it up again this week and everything 
 (level and cash) reset and crazy levels of grind for equipment and levels. It's like they decided to only support the hardcore players. Not fun anymore."
Phasmophobia,739630,178582358,"[h1] This is what happens when an indie dev doesn't listen to the community and applies favoritism [/h1]

I started playing this game a few months after the release and i really loved it. But after hiring new staff it slowly became worse with each update, i'll list what are, in my opinion, the main issues with this game:

[b] Balancement and grinding [/b] : More than an year ago the game got reset because of an update featuring tiered items, the problem with that was that you needed dozens of hours to basically go back to what you where already using before the update, and each update after that made the grinding for these items slower and slower, basically making the new player experience unbearable. At the same time it became a lot more difficult because they made the ghost abilities much more confusing and pushing for looping the ghost around tables instead of finding hiding spots or anyway trying to stay away from the ghost.

[b] Community and content creators [/b] : Because of the grind most of the casual players were pushed away from the game, and the remaining part of the community became an elitist mess who discarded every type of criticism and just told to new players to ""get gud"" when they said something against the confusing gameplay loop or about the ghost abilities that did not praise the developers or the game. Meanwhile thanks to some youtubers and QA testers it was discovered that the developers themselves only listened to their close friends instead of the community as whole, they allowed some official content creators to abuse game bugs to have an advantage and reacted poorly to the criticism of each one who wasn't their friend.

[b] Lack of updates and shortage of staff [/b] : The game sold a lot of copies but the main developer never hired more than 3-4 people because he said i wanted to keep his ""vision""of the game, the game though suffered a lot as a result because of the extremely long time between each content update, at the moment between the two newest content updates has passed more than 1 year and recently we only got a poor Halloween event and the console release that if they don't hire more stuff, will mean an even slower development of new content, as is said though, the main developer is too stubborn to hire new stuff and to listen to the part of the community that criticizes the game.


All things considered this game is on a collision course with a really sad ending, that it could only be prevented by developers and community listening to each other, but i don't have much hope that it will happen. 

I want to thank you if you read my review and i hope i helped you in deciding if you want to buy the game or not, i'll write a small TL:DR on the bottom.


TL:DR: The game is not user friendly, requires a lot of grinding to get the best items and the developer don't listen to the community and make blatant favoritism.
"
Phasmophobia,739630,178366225,"I used to like this game a lot. But some of the more recent updates has turned it from a paranormal investigation game, into one that just kills you. It's way less scary. When the game first came out there was a lot of lead up and suspense which was far more creepy than, ghost spawns, you die. It's sad because my friends and I used to enjoy this game a lot."
Phasmophobia,739630,178461222,So in the early access the game was fun with all the equipment and playing with your friends without these level up your items bullshit and now its feels too stupid to grind this type of game where you just came to enjoy with your friends and i don't know why or how the dev thought like putting up the idea of leveling up to get better gears would be an awesome idea. So yeah its just ruined now.
Phasmophobia,739630,178147197,"Apparently Private Lobby Mods are Evil, and you should wait for them to add content. (Dont worry 4 years in games on Version 0.11.0 You don't have to add mod support, but the opposition and banning of mods in a coop game is FASCINATING. I am rather convinced it is ego based. Even asking if mods are allowed seems to get you banned from related places with NO explanation. Many people would just like to play with two more people, or have new maps. Apparently this is a step too far. (Yes I am aware of the server choice they made but many issues that have seemingly been brought up seem to stem from design flaws.)"
Phasmophobia,739630,178661109,"Clunky control system and generally just...not fun? Like it has some great jumpscares on the rare occasion, don't get me wrong, but most of the time is just...like the worst detective game ever. Ghosts will spawn in but not leave any of the clues that tell you which one it is so you're on a map for like 45 minutes going ""is it this? ok but it didn't do this so it might be this? but what about this?"" until you get bored, guess, leave, get it wrong, and go ""what the fuck"". Not one I recommend, even with a good group of co-op buddies."
Phasmophobia,739630,177826058,"I really enjoy playing this game with friends or alone. It is definitely a puzzle figuring out the ghost by how they interact with the character, the items in the game and so on. Would highly recommend! I'm almost at 800 hours of playtime."
Phasmophobia,739630,177858355,"This game had so much hope and promise all those years ago, but it has barely been improved at all after all that time (eg there's still so many QoL things its needed since launch that it doesn't have, like being able to scroll backwards through the camera list), and the early-game progression is awful and has only gotten *worse* as they bloat it with more and more ghosts that aren't developed or unique enough to justify forcing a newbie to have to sift through all 2 dozen of them. They went quantity over quality and it really shows. 
There are so many other better ghost games at this point, and if you're instead looking for a fun spooky game to play with friends just buy Lethal Company - it's infinitely better in almost every way *and* way cheaper. Don't waste your money on this trite just because its the 'original'."
Phasmophobia,739630,178271303,"The game is really fun and has tons potential. after a while of playing this game it gets really boring and dull. Devs don't put out any new maps or updates and when they eventually do, the updates are very half assed and lame. They do not support modding because they claim it takes away from the precious vision they have for this game, but their vision is dull and boring. Also unfortunately the devs are awful awful people, Just look up the drama involving them and the sexual harassment that takes place in their work environment. Devs are nothing but lazy good for nothing people, that walk all over anyone that has a different opinion than them. Im glad I got to make awesome memories with my friends but I'm very sad to let this game go due to how hardly anything has changed since release."
Phasmophobia,739630,177948972,"Game is ruined after progression update. Honestly I have no desire to go through the abysmal grind to unlock everything again, especially with how much more grinding is required now. Tried my hardest to play it from the start again and give it a chance, but with how slow you level up I am just not having fun. Not everyone in the world has the time to put 50+hours into a game every time the devs want to wipe all your progress on a COOP horror game."
Phasmophobia,739630,177926940,About Halloween activities.Do you really think players can complete this activity task within 15 days? My friends and I spent the whole night with a task completion progress of 0.15%. Did you really test your own activity? Players are not slaves to this game.
Phasmophobia,739630,177972427,"A suspiciously aggressive and sneaky new EULA is a little cringe, Kinetic Games. You've had such strong support from your fans and yet you do something like this? Seriously? You should be ashamed. An EULA that grabs all the data it can makes you seem greedy and untrustworthy. Alongside that you've upped the price of the game as well, so the '""greedy"" assumption sticks even more. Beyond just the EULA, the game is incredibly grindy and the UI sucks in the HUB area. 

But I mean, the actual gameplay isn't bad. Just a shame you now have to accept a horrible EULA that takes your data and also says that they can just remove the game from your account whenever they want. 10/10"
Throne and Liberty,2429640,176948130,"So, after over 180 hours of play time and experiencing everything this game has to offer up to my servers milestones point, I think its time to give my 2 cents on this game. Usually, I don't care to review games, not worth my time, but I can't stand people who defend this game as if its the next best thing to pizza.

Is the game fun? Fun, is subjective, but to me the whole process of reaching the endgame, completing all codex entries before moving onto the next zone, was fun for what it was. Reaching endgame, the ""fun"" disappeared and you get what other MMO's have, DAILIES. Now you don't really have dailies, but you have a daily loop of things you do in order to not fall behind in content, and its a soulless experience. There is literally nothing to do outside of these dailies, almost similar to what Lost Ark was like, except the combat in Lost Ark made it somewhat bearable. The daily loop is basically: 3 dungeons, 10 contract quests, using up open world dungeon tokens, and attending world boss events(some of which are pvp contested). As for the stuff like guild missions and world events? Almost pointless to do since you'll still get guild currency for not even doing any missions and world events literally have no value outside of doing them for guild missions.

PvP is hot garbage in this game. Gear+Build > Skills, doesn't matter how good you are at your class, if you aren't playing meta builds with the best and maxed out gear, you aren't beating others who are meta and have better gear. You also will die if stunned in this game by another player, and let me tell you, there is no cooldown in between you getting stunned so you can die without being able to do anything. Throne and Liberty is also known by another name ""Tanks and Liberty"", and you will see a bunch of pvp players with 15k+ hit points that never die while being in decent gear, now imagine if they get the best gear.

P2W, lets not sugarcoat it as P2Progress. I'll be honest and say I spent some money to buy upgrades, so I can give you an idea of what money can get you. You can use your daily contracts for things like parchment or crafting stones instead of weapon/armor growth stones, since you can buy those materials with real money, thereby allowing you to gear faster. You can buy purple gear, some of which are best in slot, instead of farming for them via rng, or pity crafting. You can buy ""traits"" and max them out, which is why you see players who aren't tanks, that have over 12k hit points while the average player has 6 to 8k with the ""max hp"" trait. You can also pay guilds to give you loot drops from world bosses, because guilds change how loot works, and your boss loot goes into guild storage where the leader can give it to other players as well. To all the P2W deniers, this is a PvP game with PvE content, and unless you as someone who doesn't spend money can beat a 3100 CP player with video proof - you're in denial.

The community. Its honestly already starting to look toxic, much sooner than Lost Ark showed its toxicity. You already have gatekeeping groups for PvE content, and good luck trying to get into any good guild unless you have extremely high CP and with the correct viable builds(So none of you players with Greatsword/Wand, SwordShield/Staff, etc). You can join a casual guild, but this is a PvP game, not made for casuals.

I don't recommend this game to anyone who values their time or money. Its not worth investing either of those into this game unless you enjoy PvP and are willing to spend money."
Throne and Liberty,2429640,177443407,"this game has a lot of potential but they do not do enough to control the strength of pay to win players and the guilds/alliances they form. guilds with players willing to pay for progression end up stronger than most guilds quickly. when they then form alliances through game provided means, they can overpower a server and gatekeep content from thousands of players. when new content releases and no one in the server can access it besides the pay to win players, it kills the game. the way alliances work in the game should be revised."
Throne and Liberty,2429640,177564119,"It's pretty pay to win, but at the same time it kinda isn't.

There's a basically a cap that you can get to in terms of power. For the most part, you can get to that cap as a F2P player. It may take you a few weeks to maybe a month of consistent playing while the whales can do it in 20 minutes of swiping, but you can get there.

Once you DO get there, you're even with them. It's not like they can $$$$$ into infinity so you can never catch them, it just takes time playing the game. In my opinion playing the game because it's fun to do is the whole point, so don't worry about when you get there.

Also side note; You can get the in game currency without too much issue as a F2P once you hit endgame, which will also help you gear faster.

I say give the game a try if everything else looks good to you, I think it's great. Best and most engaging MMO I've played in years, and I've played most of them"
Throne and Liberty,2429640,178713778,"TnL turned out to be pay to win, and it affects PvP, the cash whales and big guilds own the servers"
Throne and Liberty,2429640,178719317,"This game is a social pvp game. While it has some PVE elements, it's not enough to keep PVE players engaged for more than a few weeks. The gearing system is probably the most convoluted and grindy experience I've had in an MMO. Combat feels like a worse version of Guild Wars 2. Visually, it's beautiful, but zones and world building lack a soul, and you'll find yourself unimpressed despite the high graphical fidelity."
Throne and Liberty,2429640,178670231,"Predatory in game loot system designed to try and trick players into spending real world money to be competitive, don't fall for it like I did. 

Easy uninstall"
Throne and Liberty,2429640,177815475,"p2w players guild up and gatekeep eveyone else from content. PVP system is rock paper CC,no diminishing returns on hard CC means eternal stun into prone into sleep into stun into respawn. Endgame trait system is a nightmare, and the game is flooded with bots so the auction system is a mess of over priced items meant for only the whales to have...45k lucient for a boss drop weapon?? that's roughly 900 USD get real 
3/10 wouldn't recommend"
Throne and Liberty,2429640,177530529,"This game is so terrible  that I couldn't even make it 3 hrs play time. Its hard to believe this is a sequel to Lineage. Its a testament to how bad new games are that people go back to the older games .. Its free so its not as if you are wasting money, just wasting time. I would think with a company like Amazon backing this game it would be better. It appears Amazon is just looking for tax write off's rather than quality games."
Throne and Liberty,2429640,177073879,"The single player story feels condensed at best.  They introduce characters/storylines that you are supposed to care about, then you kill them off two missions later.  Powerful demon who has been around for centuries?  I killed him off the same mission I learned about him... Other powerful demon?  Only a mission or two more.  The big bad?  A mission or two after I met him.  So I definitely wouldn't recommend the game for the story.

Gameplay is fine, except you are limited to two characters, it is a pain to switch weapons if you change your mind, and a bunch of stuff (e.g. the battlepass) is CHARACTER and not account bound.  Once you finish the story it becomes about a ridiculous grind, and you can screw yourself over if you don't know various tricks (e.g. don't immediately transfer your blue weapon into a purple weapon, apparently is better to wait to save growthstones) or make poor choices.

The morphing doesn't really add anything, it is just the equivalent of sprint.  The glide morph is incredibly frustrating.  You can only glide and not fly, you go less distance if you can altitude, you will unmorph if you hit a branch or other minor obstacle, and you will randomly nosedive into the ground.  It just feels bad in every respect.

PvP is a stunlock zergfest.  I didn't sense any real opportunity for strategy or even real combat.  Maybe is better if you focus solely on PvP with your build, e.g. choosing the correct weapons and the correct skills at creation, but that requires foreknowledge.  If you just try to play the game good luck, it won't be fun.

Definitely feels like there are meta 'correct' choices for weapons and skills for various activities.  Want to compete in world events and PvP?  Good luck...

Maybe I have been out of MMOs for too long, but the dungeons are just tedious rather than challenging.  Numerous instant kill 'mechanics' that you need to be aware of in advance to create faux challenge.  Doing the same thing every two minutes to avoid instant death is not a fun or challenging boss, it's just annoying especially if you dare play with a PUG.  

Various gacha/mobile style time gates.  You can't run as many dungeons as you want, only X number, you can't do as many contracts as you want, just X number, you only get X abyssal coins, you only can by X eggs/honeys, etc.

The store is ridiculously overpriced.  And a real money auction house is obnoxious.  I don't know what is more ridiculous, that I sold a world boss drop for the equivalent of $100, or that they 'taxed' the equivalent of $20 of a currency that you have to buy from them.  This might tie into other mechanics, but will only reward the top whale/zerg guilds if it does.  

It feels like a game that will quickly become about the whales/sweats (or whatever the term is) dominating everything, and everyone else just being there to provide them with fodder."
Throne and Liberty,2429640,177194397,"This game belongs to the late 2000s with all its clunky and stupid combat, absolute zero creativity in how skills and power fantasy supposed to work, luck of art design vectoring to deep nothing, with somewhat dumb personal progression tight to hugest possible in MMO time consumption ( plus huge p2w correlation) and need to play with brain rotted console players besides not really smart players that can't execute simple mechanics or able to play with their toolkit properly when there is ton of guides in internet.
Yes. All this game is offering yet is just performance, living world for now with players in it and somewhat decent representation of UE4. Honestly, this game was more interesting as Lineage 3 Diablo-like from 2010ish announcements or stand alone mobile dogwater."
Throne and Liberty,2429640,177557685,"They have begun making it more difficult to progress in gear. They now changed how much growth stones and skill books are required to grow to the next level. On top of that, they made it harder to succeed each time you try, meaning you will get a poor to low success - thus making you use more stones and books. Bots are now becoming a problem and those people are not even trying to hide it. Free to play is only and idea and if you think you can do what very few can do by getting lucent by auction house, think again. Just play for a bit and quit is my recommendation"
Throne and Liberty,2429640,178276786,"TL;DR: Try it out since its free but be aware of the honeymoon phase the game is still in right now. Solid game on the surface, getting worse the deeper you get. You are forced into one build (two weapons) and preferably one or two at most skill preset(s) and will have to stick on it due to how punishing rerolling weapons is.

-Leveling: is ok, nothing special but its kind of fast compared to other mmos

-Combat: is uninspired button smashing, you do your ""opener"" once and then just smash the button that comes off of cooldown for PVE and PVP in smallscale (arena) is just who stuns who first and just die. Largescale is like every other large scale mmo about shotcalling, numbers on members and some coordination. If youre seeking for class complexity this is the wrong game for you.

-Graphics: very good to be fair

-Community: depends, my server was partially extremely toxic enviroment between top guilds and between top guilds and the rest of the server. I personally dont have a problem with toxicity and was bm'ing aswell sometimes but if you're sensitive it may be not for you. so yes I was part of the problem but its an asian pvp mmo so its nothing new.

-Daily loop: absolute cancer in my eyes and I am sorry for these words but I cant find any other for that. If you played lost ark its basically the same. everything is timegated but on top of that you are forced to do the daily stuff otherwise you will be capped on ressources after a few days. Not for me. Another comparison if you played BDO: its like agris fever which will fill up daily up to a maximum but in TnL you dont have 1 system like that, no you have 2 of them plus one ressource that stacks up when you use one of the other ones. Wasnt for me, i stopped doing daily shit after getting my build ready. this plus the other activities that will come across for you when youre joining a competitive pvp guild (conflict bosses, pvp events, rift/boonstone wars) it just felt like a 2nd job and if you really want to min max everything and getting to a high rank in the ranking system you basically have to be unemployed)

-Monetization: In short: LOL. Full: I dont recommend swiping at all, their prices are predatory for the amount of worth you get out of it. thats why they immediately banned RMT with draconic punishment (they basically took away the lucent you bought illegally and force you to buy the amount youre in negative to use the auction house again). Which is fine but they should ask themselves why ppl instantly started RMT that much, because its completly not reasonable. Its like buying currency on a mobile game, it just feels off and you feel robbed. I didnt RMT personally but still have the opinion that they shouldnt be surprised that this would happen.

-Misc: There are techniques and hidden knowledge for the systems in the game that are recommended to know in my opinion. When EA started it forced many players (me included) to restart on a fresh character because it just wasnt worth to continue on the first one. So I strongly recommend to do your research because the game is very punishing when doing mistakes.

My conclusion is that it was somewhat fun for nearly 300 hours now but uninstalling was followed by a big relief. I will come back for T2 to look around but I dont see myself playing it in long term."
Throne and Liberty,2429640,177608525,"Graphics 9/10 - RTX 4090 semi-daily memory leaks even with different GPU, MB, Memory
Main Story: 7/10 - Mid-budget Korean level storytelling with little cut scenes character development, etc
PvE Combat: 8/10 - Standard tab-target feels like other developer MMO movement (Rift) Combat is fluid
PvP Combat: 8/10 - Combat is fluid with hard counter classes and emergency skills, but IRL purchases have caused a massive imbalance that gate keeps normal players from having a chance.

Pros: Game world is large, 8 leveling dungeons with end game versions of them, lots of timer based world events, open world dungeons for grinding, open world bosses, guild vs guild content, weekly/daily quests, cooking, fishing, crafting, and Auction House

The game is being released in ""phases"" so not ALL content is accessible, giving each server player base a chance to go through content in a reasonable pace, preventing gaming locusts and 24/7 no lives from rushing through content. Since the game is completely focused on Guild Vs Guild PvP, the phased release is needed for guild players to have an even playing field for leveling and content consumption. It also makes sure the community of $$$ swipers will have a much even pace, and spend even MORE IRL purchases on gear, since no one can rush to the very end game gear and sell it...yet

Cons: Auction house is completely in real-world money, and has completely destroyed the game with large guilds of IRL purchasers maxing their characters way past anything achievable other than a 24/7 F2P player with supporting buffed up guild. These guilds lock people out of world boss content in two ways:

1. World bosses spawn with open world PvP active and your character can get deleted in 1-2 hits, plus the boss can kill you in 1-2 hits. 90% of the time when world bosses spawn they go untouched
2. World bosses spawn with NON-PvP active and everyone attacks, deleting the boss in a few minutes but rare gear reward drops based off of performance, so IRL purchasers again get all the loot and sell in on auction house for HUGE IRL prices, which bumps up the price of what everyone else is selling, leading to AH gear prices to astronomical costs (think Star Citizen ship sales levels)

3. Once you've completed the initial campaign and completed the dungeons that's all the content for PvE players, except for grinding till your eyeballs bleed for small chance rare gear drops. However, the amount of times you can run dungeons each week is arbitrarily gated by dungeon currency needed to open boss chests
4. Guild leaders get world boss loot drops, NOT the guildies and they often times (most toxic) take it for themselves and their ALT characters, or (least toxic) prefer to give drops to their friends or ransom the loot drop for a ""guild auction"" to get money from the players.

5. Server dungeon queues often demand INSANE gear scores for even the starter end game dungeons because of all the IRL purchasers and early access players, leaving new players or casual players out in the cold and ""request to join group denied"" if they have normal gear level for those dungeons where they NEED the loot drops from those dungeons to gain higher gear score."
Throne and Liberty,2429640,177449293,"The pvp is weak and a total zerg fest. Gives no options to deal with CC. Zero auction house market or player trading without RMT. The bots are hilarious. Mage and healer skill options are extremely limited. The dual weapon scheme leaves you feeling more limited than actually giving options. Hope they improve things, has potential."
Throne and Liberty,2429640,177268368,very limited options for gameplay. 6 dungeons on repeat gets old fast
Throne and Liberty,2429640,177108811,"Would I recommend? Probably not. Game is very P2W, auction house currency is the same as cash shop currency, which does have some perks, you can sell items to pay for your cosmetics and battle-pass etc. But for me, having P2W built into a game that's PvP based is a big PASS. Dungeons are tiny and a bit poor, most boss fights are mediocre at best, many have the usual “constant stun” and “one shot unavoidable AOE attacks”. The combat in general isn’t that bad, and the audio/visuals of the game are really well done. As said above, I probably wouldn't recommend it, but It's F2P, so if your bored, give it a try, what do you have to loose."
Throne and Liberty,2429640,177261541,"i been playing for many many hours now, but i can already tell i will rage quit due to the balance of pvp :)
zerg is dominated by flash wave
arena is dominated by melee 
trash game."
Throne and Liberty,2429640,177147181,"well i tried it and after levelling two characters to 50 i've deleted it

just not for me

on the plus side the graphics are good and the servers appear to be largely solid as a rock with good response times

now the negative side

its a conversion from a Korean game, the main story is rubbish and your character appears to be mute as it doesn't actually utter one audible word just gestures with hands 

way too many mobs in game, you quite literally cannot run anywhere without some low level mob giving you aggro including flying over their heads 100 feet in the air

bots did i mention bots, trains of bots killing mobs and gathering and killing mobs, trains of them, folks were saying how can this be its a new mmo without realising its a convert from its Korean original so yes all ready set up just like Lost Ark was

crafting lol what crafting lets remove one of the most important crafting items from the game to stop you from crafting blue gear as not everyone can craft purple

trade post another joke, takes ages to refresh then you need real money to buy their ingame tokens to spend there, yeah right that will work well

now the serious stuff, the combat when compared to things like Elder Scrolls is a complete and utter joke with a capital J. Why i hear you ask well, you as usual have a main hand weapon and an off hand weapon but then you have upto 12 skills available on your skills bar at the same time, no concept of switching weapon as such to switch the weapon and the skills available so your using crossbow skill whilst holding a longbow, complete trash (apart from the spinning crossbow skill that basically kills all mobs within 5m now thats a nice animation to watch) its just a button mashing job at best

after a week of the same events rotating i really didn't want to hear about the wolves hunt and what to do every couple of hours 

now don't be a tank or a healer as boss chests are at present based on damage done so kinda useless being one of those builds as you get nothing

we have the usual pro dungeon freaks must be 2k plus dps to run with me not got it then your not elite enough to be in my team 

gold sellers of course based on the afore mentioned bots and those lovely sellers offering dungeon runs so they get the drops to sell back to public

now after years of playing mmo's with a keyboard and mouse i have finally trained my aging paws to mash a controller and its buttons, oh great this game has controller option built in rather than Steams overlay this will be fun, omg what a horrible, chunky, frustrating interface that results in  many a time the controller nearly being thrown through the monitor. folks i really dont want that big blue X to appear over the rss node ive just run up to i want to see the pretty piece of art you guys did in designing the node and how close i am standing to it - oh yes BIG plus here, you cannot be aggro'd off of a node, you know that old school mmo trick of bugger he's got there first i'll aggro this monster onto him so he stops gathering and i can nip in and steal it. Yes the devs got this bit right at least, once you are gathering a node you cannot be knocked off of it by a mob, yey and up yours griefers 

still, the graphics look nice, but not enough for me, back to Eso for the more skillfull combat and stealth"
Throne and Liberty,2429640,177720298,"Yet another Good Game AGS kills with their piss poor decisions.. I don't understand how this Company isn't out of business yet. Who thought it was a good idea to allow people 2 free transfers a day for 3 weeks?? Literally enabled guilds to hop from server to server and get extra guild boss runs. (exploited by the big zerg, we all know who but I will refrain from naming). They at least got 5x more guild boss runs than guilds that didn't transfer at all.. 

Good Job AGS... Good Job.. This game will be dead just like Lost Ark after the first Castle Siege."
Throne and Liberty,2429640,177235103,"Amazon has fucked this one up for sure. After you get past the minor issues that you can deal with such as shitty server stability and crashes that didn't exist on the KR version, now they locked everyone who transferred prior to today with a 30 day CD while telling everyone that you had the ability to transfer basically one last time after today with a cooldown. They completely lied to the player base so that players could start on free-to-play servers in the hope of being able to join their friends later, which they have never been able to. Don't waste your time. It's a pay to win game that you probably won't like, especially with Amazon in charge of it."
Silent Hill 2,2124490,177673713,"Yes, I played the OG when it first released in 2001, and it’s remained one of my favorites to this day. I’ve listened to the soundtrack more times than I can count. Hell, I used to listen to the game rip before bed just to relax (you know, the industrial noises that sound like “rocks banging around a washing machine”). None of that makes me an expert on the series, though, nor does it even matter. Silent Hill 2 isn’t the same game that was released in 2001. Sure, there are aspects of the original that I prefer and don’t believe can ever be fully replicated, but Silent Hill 2 is a good game. No…it’s a GREAT game! And that’s WAY more than I expected to say when it was first announced two years ago.

Silent Hill has been, and always will be, about atmosphere. These games instill a sense of dread in me that I can’t fully explain or comprehend, and that is why I constantly find myself returning to them time and again. To step back into that world for the first time in over a decade has been a dream come true! What Bloober Team was able to accomplish has finally brought me home to where my love of survival horror had all begun.

Despite my initial worries, the story remains faithful through and through, with added scenes, tweaks to conversations, and new character interactions elevating its emotional core even further. The actors are beyond fantastic. Luke Roberts adds so much depth to James Sunderland's character, he feels like a flesh and blood human being. I’ve seen comments that the performances are flat and lack the emotional poignancy of the OG, but I don't agree at all. These actors ARE the characters; you can see it in every expression, hear it in every sigh, read it in every utterance… There are moments when I know EXACTLY what a character is thinking, and they haven’t said a single word. Granted, there are a few line deliveries from the original that come off more intensely authentic, but I far and away prefer the new performances to the old, and don’t find them to be any less “dreamy” or effective. James is more than a grieving husband. Maria is more than a trampy harlot. Angela’s pain and trauma is so on display that I can’t understand how anyone can look at her and not instantly feel their heart rend in two... Eddie is, well, Eddie, but I like that he’s less a of goof and more of a ticking-time-bomb, and that works perfectly for his redesigned boss fight. 

If there’s anything that has been improved over the original, however, it’s the combat. All of the old weaponry is accounted for (save for one item, but I like what they did with it thematically), and they feel satisfying to use, especially the melee weapons. The heft of the board with nails, and later on the pipe, is palpable when you’re bashing the monsters into a bloody pulp. Granted, it’s not as thrilling as Leon S. Kennedy round-house kicking ganados, but it feels weighty and impactful, and I never really got tired of it. James’ increasingly unhinged grunts and screams as he’s bashing away at eldritch monstrosities don’t hurt either. The gunplay, while basic, is serviceable without making James feel overpowered; even while using keyboard and mouse, landing hits isn’t always a guarantee. The way the enemies move is often unpredictable and requires some finesse with the dodge button, but that’s all part of making the mechanics more engaging. James isn’t a commando, nor does he play like one, so you’ll be on your toes from start to finish, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.

Then there are the graphics. I’m not lying when I tell you this may be one of the best looking games I have ever played. The world design, the environmental detail, the lighting, the fog, the grime, the decay and blood and rust, it all adds to the immersion and makes me want to explore every nook and cranny ‘til I’ve uncovered all the little secrets the game has to offer. The ONLY issue I have with so much graphical fidelity is that sometimes the increased detail doesn’t allow the mind to fill in all those disgusting little cracks with even more horrific imagery. But that’s where shadow comes into play.

The darkness in Silent Hill is almost an entity in-of-itself. The way it swallows James’ surroundings, especially in the Otherworld, eliciting feelings of claustrophobic isolation…it's near perfection. I’ve never seen darkness wielded so well in a horror game. When you’re drowning in a sea of black, when not even your own flashlight burns bright enough to push back the encroaching shadows, every source of light is a welcome respite from the horror. You’ll definitely need to have ray tracing turned on to get the most out of the lighting effects, however. Without it, the dark areas are TOO dark, and you’ll be forced to increase the gamma to the point that the shadows aren’t nearly as ominous as they should be. For some, that may mean their performance gets dumped into the toilet, but if you can at least play at a stable 30 fps with RT on, I’d highly recommend it over the alternative. 

As for where the game falters, it's in the sound design. Most of the ambient sounds are remastered from the OG, but I feel part of what made the original so unsettling is that there was rawness to the “noise” that feels overproduced with the remastering. It’s like when an artist remasters an old song, it rarely has the same vibe as the original. Imperfection creates character, and taking it away doesn’t always make something better. In a game where the degradation of your surroundings is actually part of the story, losing those imperfections actually removes a bit of the horror. Then there’s the silence. The moments when James is surrounded by the complete absence of sound are few and far between, and THAT is the biggest failure in the sound design. There’s nothing like walking down a hallway and the only thing you hear are James’ footsteps echoing throughout the darkness. It not only instills a sense of loneliness in the player, but creates unease as our emotions are no longer being lead by what we hear. Now don’t get me wrong, the sound design isn't at all horrible. It WILL freak you out, especially while traversing the darker environments, doubly so if you’ve never played one of these games before, but it’s missing the eeriness of the original that I’m not sure can be recaptured, and that's a shame.

Of course, there are also the performance issues, which are difficult to get around no matter how beefy your system is. Despite upgrading specifically for this game, my RTX4080/Ryzen 9 5950x combo at 1440p was still struggling, and the stuttering and frame drops proved to be far more than mere annoyances. It took days of fiddling with settings, installing mods, and endless engine.ini manipulations to determine that none of it was really fixing anything. So I dropped the mods, switched DLSS off, turned Rebar on, cut my monitor’s refresh rate in half, and capped my fps to 60, and that gave me a smooth enough experience to truly enjoy my stay. That said, I can completely understand how the performance issues are a deal breaker for many, but even at its worst, I was still able to enjoy myself enough to overlook these technical difficulties. 

To be honest, I could probably write another half dozen paragraphs on the game (I didn’t even touch on the boss fights, symbolism, theories and new endings), but this review has gone on for far too long. Despite some minor grievances, Silent Hill 2 is a fantastic return to form for the seminal horror series, and I really, TRULY hope future games continue on this trajectory, because I want MORE. I NEED more. Whether it’s another remake, a new entry, or just more Silent Hill media in general, we need games like Silent Hill. There really isn't anything else out there quite like it, and I’m overjoyed that it’s finally back to fill the hole in my horror-loving heart.

Silent Hill 2,2124490,177106749,"[h1] Silent Hill 2, Running Through The Fog[/h1]

Silent Hill 2 (2024) is a remake of the original game that modernizes the gameplay to be less clunky while also adding more content, and endings and fixing a lot of the original's flaws. Even with all the changes, Bloober has made sure to respect the original vision and keep the essence of the game intact, as the town is as scary and unsettling as it always has been.

This remake doesn't have anything to be jealous of the Resident Evil ones, as the technical level of the game is impressive, resulting in a redemption arc for the developer, that managed to make a game of this caliber after numerous failures. 23 years later, we get the best version of the game there is as we revisit James Sunderland and Silent Hill.

[h1]What Makes It Worth Playing?[/h1]

The remake doubles the duration of the original game, lasting around 14 hours on average while the original would be around 8 hours, giving more content to enjoy and digest. The details in the game are also a nice touch, as being able to break windows of cars and stands for ammo and healing items makes you look at the scenery with more attention. Other details like Maria reacting to James' flashlight, or Eddie's breath being cold due to his version of the Otherworld being colder, are subtle but add a nice touch to the immersion.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3349313591

The game also introduces new endings, making a second playthrough more enticing, and the speedrun challenge of beating the game in less than 10 hours (which I got ;3) adds replayability to the adventure once one finishes the core of it. With the gameplay being reworked to feature a more fluid experience that packs more action and strategy regarding movement, Silent Hill 2 ends up being a remake that gets you hooked, always wanting to play ""one more area"" before putting the controller down.

[h1] Bloober Doesn't Cut Corners, Improving Upon The Original[/h1]

Bloober has improved upon the game by adding tension to it, something that the original can be missing at times. Bosses now have more room to move around, resulting in high-paced action where foes don't let you breathe. For example, Pyramid Head encounters in the original were mostly a small empty room, but in the remake, the room is bigger, has rain and there are objects James has to use to avoid being sliced by Pyramid Head, resulting in more action and strategy for the encounter. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3349314102

Puzzles have been revamped too, becoming at times a bit easier but generally harder, and answers from 23 years ago in the original won't work in the remake. In addition, each difficulty has its solutions to the puzzles that are different, and some of them even have randomly generated ones, adding to the challenge. The map no longer pauses the game either, making exploration and solving of puzzles nerve-wracking as you are in a dark corridor trying to get your beatings. Sometimes, Pyramid Head will chase the player in some area like Resident Evil 3 Nemesis, making it worse!


[h1] More Action Means More Horror[/h1]

I know some of the readers and those on the fence might be like ""More action, less scared!"" but is the opposite. By adding more enemies, there is always a sensation that something can (and will!) jump from the darkness to attack you. Being wary of the fact that foes can appear at any moment, adds tension to the atmosphere of the game! Certain areas such as Toluca Prison felt confined and crushing to me, as the entire area is dark, with timed switches that bring light for a few seconds in long corridors, and when the light goes out halfway through, the enemies will jump from everywhere, walls, ceilings, etc. The fact that Toluca Prison is a long segment makes for a more tense experience where one wants to get out of the complex ASAP. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3349314933

The sound design is so impressive that I doubt there will be a game with a better sound design in 2024. Enemies move around and noises in the background result in ""Did that come from the game or real life?"" giving more immersion. Pyramid Head dragging his big knife is something that keeps me awake at night, and some enemies make noises that are either disgusting or disturbing. Let me add real quick that finding enemies in the game is a nice detail that is tricky, the flashlight will blink when a foe is close by, but it will also count little spiders, giving a false alarm of sorts. If you have the controller on vibration mode, the rain can mimic that of enemies, resulting in the rain providing cover for them not only visually, but in gameplay as well. 

[h1]Price Point Analysis and Replayability[/h1]

For 70 bucks, you are getting your money's worth (did that rhyme? Hopefully not). The game is a technical marvel that does an excellent job when it comes to visuals, sounds, atmosphere, and gameplay, resulting in one of the best titles of the year 2024. The only thing holding the game back a bit is that we are missing the Born From a Wish Maria chapter, which could perhaps be added as a DLC, and that the game can crash, resulting in a loss of progression (especially in Lakeside, it crashes more than usual!) During my experience, I suffered 7 crashes, not a lot per se but frustrating having to redo certain segments. Oh well! I didn't crash in Toluca Prison at least, phew!

[h1] Conclusion[/h1]

To anyone who said Bloober couldn't do justice to the game, I am expecting an apology now (I jest but seriously the devs have proven themselves). The game ended up in good hands with the team, and Silent Hill 2 ended up being an improved version that is unpredictable, unnerving, and exciting! It finds a careful balance between keeping the original vision and adding new changes that reinvigorate the experience. Silent Hill 2 couldn't be in better hands, and I am hoping we get a remake of the first title, Silent Hill, with this team.

10/10 MASTERPIECE

Silent Hill 2,2124490,177546075,"This game can teach you a lot of useful things, but the most important one is that you definitely shouldn't shake hands with James."
Silent Hill 2,2124490,178049451,"OG SH2 is one of my favorite games of all time and I must say Bloober knocked it out of the park with this remake.

OGSH2 was stressful because of the atmosphere of dread and the idea that something terrible could happen at any moment, but the actual gameplay was on the easy side.

This remake not only recaptures everything great about the OG in terms of its art direction, sound design, voice acting etc., but it actually makes SH2 scary again for those of us who already know what's going to happen. The combat is really good and tense and it keeps you on your toes even on standard difficulty.

Last night I got out of the hospital and managed to get to the wrench and honestly that journey really took something out of me. I was left feeling exhausted and slightly traumatized in the best possible way.

Congrats to Bloober for having recaptured lightning in a bottle in a way that is at once respectful of the past while also reinvigorating. I am so looking forward to SH3 remake."
Silent Hill 2,2124490,177059110,"Was my first time playing Silent Hill 2, great experience, great remake! Had no issues at all. The Game also has 32:9 support which is a big win."
Silent Hill 2,2124490,177633842,"I was 14/15 years old when I played Silent Hill 2 on Ps2. Replaying the Remake is a great emotion for me and I will enjoy it until the end.
However, there are some bugs right from the start. Many Armless Man/Lying Figures remain stuck under the cars. Hopefully they will fix it with some patches.
This game has a great emotional value for me dating back to my childhood and my vote can only be 9/10. The wait was long."
Silent Hill 2,2124490,177235087,"Silent Hill 2 Remake perhaps is the best horror game in history in terms of its atmosphere. The developers have exceeded all expectations by creating a unique and believable world. The story is told superbly and remains relevant even after 23 years.

This remake is perfect for newcomers to the series. Sometimes, it is simply impossible not to be scared of it: the sound, visuals, and plot create an incredible sense of immersion. Fans of the horror genre will definitely not be left unimpressed.

In terms of gameplay, the game is surprisingly straightforward: at the normal difficulty level, it's almost impossible to die, as there are plenty of health items and weapons. However, the challenge here lies mainly in the atmosphere, because many times you just scared of empty coridors, closed doors and etc. It's pure brilliance. 

The main problem is pacing. Although the remake is nearly twice as long as the original, all of the additional time is gameplay. Story remains about the same length. This is noticeable, as the gameplay segments seem to be too long and there aren't enough scenes to break up the gameplay.

Despite these minor flaws, however, the Silent Hill 2 remake is remarkable. I am glad the series is back. The Bloober Team has managed to surprise me — and all of us."
Silent Hill 2,2124490,176946891,"[h1] A new player's perspective [/h1]

I had no real intention of buying this game or playing it. I saw a brief bit of gameplay and thought, ""ok, what the hell..."" Silent Hill 2 (Remake) is now [strike]potentially[/strike] my favorite game in the genre. The moment to moment action is engaging, eerie, and often deeply stressful. James saunters from one nightmare to the next. All the while, it's hard to know what's real and how reliable of perspective James Sunderland provides to the audience. Is this man clinically insane? Is everyone else psychotic? Are the events unfolding really happening? And if they are, why are they?

Silent Hill 2 is a fantastic psychological horror mystery with tremendous acting and is well worth the price of admission. This title is an unexpected favorite of mine this year, and it's a game I'll be going back to for NG+ and it's multiple endings for years to come. 🍻"
Silent Hill 2,2124490,177830147,"[h1]an incredible Remake of a masterpiece[/h1]
I've not completed the classic version in the past, but after playing this, I might now.
this is a perfect atmospheric horror game made by a studio that was its first time creating a survival horror, and they nailed it. people in Capcom need to keep their heads up because they might have a worthy competitor now.

the gameplay is good but can be better and the dodge mechanic is a little bit op and the game is a little bit easy but it doesn't affect the work of art they created with Silent Hill 2 
I love the atmosphere in this game so much that its the only reason I'm gonna beat it for the second time, and the fact that this is made in unreal engine with this level of graphics makes it even more atmospheric.
I swear I can wander in that foggy city for hours and not get tired at all.

and I don't have to say anything for the story cuz it's about the same as the classic, with some little difference and 2 new endings that adds even more things to talk about, but sadly I cant do that because you should experience it yourself.

the only thing I can say to criticize the game is that ""otherworld"" levels are a little bit frustrating, especially in Brookhaven Hospital, but that feeling of frustration faded away while visiting the next areas of the game, and I have to say I'm surprised that I didn't have any problems with the prison, it sounded like a boring level but it was okay, and even if I had any, it would've been gone by the time I reached the Lakeview hotel, that was the best area they created in this game, even better than the silent hill city, I wish I could visit a hotel like that in real life, with all those foggy and empty hallways, it gives me a feeling of unease and I kinda like that, this whole game was a big liminal space of its self, I can't believe silent hill created that feeling even before backrooms in 2001 and I missed it somehow until today

Overall, very good game, everyone should play this masterpiece

Those sudden moments of terror creep up on you in the best way possible, completely changing the mood in an instant.

I recently completed my first playthrough and I am eager to discover what else the game has to offer, as well as explore the different endings. Overall, Silent Hill 2 is an absolute must-play if you enjoy survival horror games. I was blown away by the whole experience."
Silent Hill 2,2124490,176941068,"The remake does a surprisingly good job at capturing the ""feel"" of the original game while modernizing it in the areas that make sense to, such as the environments and the controls.

The progression through each area is slightly more linear than before, but not in a way that makes it feel particularly hand-holdy or on rails -- just in a way that makes it a little harder to get lost with no idea where you should be going next, which I actually appreciated, because I have plenty of memories of just wandering around the areas in the original game, trying every door and hoping to stumble across something I'd missed. A few areas that were a bit lacking in the original game are even improved this time around, such as the Labyrinth being a bit more fleshed-out.

While I went into this with no expectations, I came away feeling like this was every bit as successful of a re-imagining as the Resident Evil 2 remake was, IMO. Easy to recommend to any fans of the originals or classic survival horror games in general."
Silent Hill 2,2124490,177049222,"Very good remake! The game has stunning graphics, which include detailed environments and enhanced character models. The sound design is very well made, as it amplifies the eerie ambiance of the game. Voice acting has been improved, and it stays true to the original's narrative. Overall, the remake provides a compelling experience for both newcomers and longtime fans of the series."
Silent Hill 2,2124490,177956288,"The game is a perfect adaptation, or rather, translation of the original. The long story short it is a timeless masterpiece. It makes excellent and brilliant tweaks to adapt to modern audiences and storytelling, such as updating the graphics, enhancing the sound design, and refining the gameplay mechanics. Every chilling aspect of the original is flawlessly remade and even improved upon in some areas. The characters maintain their slightly off-putting presence and dialogue. The enemies are ruthless and unforgiving. The combat is hectic and best described as frantic. It's ugly, it's brutal, it's visceral. Every swing of a pipe and every blast from a shotgun feels like there's violent intention behind it. The story is preserved, including fan-favorite moments from the original. Some scenes are added here and there throughout to help expand upon some characters. The new models and voices for the characters do an excellent job of translating the original. There are even a few new endings added. 

The sound design is unlike ANYTHING I've heard from a video game—very subtle noises as you wander through dark corridors and it was remarkable. There are no apparent generic footsteps near you, just things that sound like they don't belong. Enough to constantly question whether it's the game or something in your room. It is brilliant. This game is winning awards on sound design alone, mark my words. The soundtrack is as great as ever, and Akira Yamaoka returned to produce it. The intro song is superb, subtly referencing Silent Hill 1's original opening. There wasn't a track that I felt was a letdown at all. There are even some tracks from the OG that return with little to no change at all. Not playing this game is a disservice to yourself. This deserves owning a physical copy. It's that good. This is a generation-defining release for the horror/survival horror genre, a game that will be remembered for years to come. I intend to say it all in the craze around this title. The game has excellent content, and it took me 9.5 hours of play to complete it in standard combat and in advanced puzzle-solving mode. If you're a gamer like me, who likes to finish games 100% and see all endings, buckle up for this 35-40 hour adventure.

The Bloober team knocked it out of the park, and I cannot wait until they eventually move on to Silent Hill 1, maybe 3, and 4."

Bloober Team has still some things to do better in the next installments (for example making the town a real open world instead of a guided passage again) but all in all I'm in love with this remake.

What I'm not in love with is Konami's disgusting advertising-strategy to sell the Deluxe Edition with A ""Digital Soundtrack"" and not with THE ""Digital Soundtrack"".
Instead of the complete 93-track soundtrack they previewed on youtube, you only get a 10-track-selection from that complete soundtrack.
An absolute disgusting scam.
When I get the missing 83 tracks, this will turn into a positive review; until then negative it is.

UPDATE:
I just received my response-mail from the Konami-support and they made clear that the Deluxe Edition only comes with a 10-track soundtrack and that this won't get extended on November 20th.
This means two things:
a) the negative review will stay
b) YARR-HARR!"
Silent Hill 2,2124490,177111388,"Thanks to Bloober team for making this beautiful game. The atmosphere of the game is really great and scary and I had a great time with the different environments and puzzles. The issue that exists is the lack of variety of enemies in the game and in some places the challenge is low even on the medium difficulty level. The gameplay could have more depth or the tools used, but the same amount of music and voice acting was good from this excellent producer. 9/10"
Silent Hill 2,2124490,177422359,"So, I have completed a first playthrough of the game and all I can say is that my expectations were beaten. That would be a bold triumphant moment, but said expectations were extremely low, so beating them is not much of an achievement. Nevertheless, I must say that the game is surprisingly good and - what is important - clearly made by people who understood the original very well and had their own vision.

Technically speaking, changes-wise, the remake is very tame, and of the key elements they made significant changes to two characters (Maria and Eddie) and added several narrative scenes crystallizing certain traits of the players in this drama. Some changes are positive - say, it is much easier now to take Eddie's line more seriously, however endearing the original was.

Visually, we have insanely good work with surroundings - area design, deterioration in Otherworld, mud, dirt, rust, ""normal"" areas, all done incredibly well and are at the same time recognizable and authentic. Monsters also shine - not only they are true to the original, Bloober actually found a way to expand the original roster without actually expanding it. Line Figures come in three options now instead of 2, Mannikins and Nurses also have a variant with different moveset, Mandarins previously present in a single scene ([i]edit: I do need to replay the original, maybe they actually were encountered twice[/i]), now got a full compensation and rule at least three significant sections of the game, playing slightly different roles in each. Plus, modified combat mechanics and behaviour lead to developers being able to actively combine mobs, requiring the player to do the doom thing and think what tools to use at which enemy.

Combat-wise there are many questionable things. First, the combat is almost unavoidable now. You will have to kill most enemies. You technically can run past many of them, and if you clearly know what you are doing, you can reduce your fighting by half, but there still clearly are some situations that are built around assuming you go in and kill everyone. Melee combat is context-based. You auto-lock to an opponent and attack that opponent. You can dodge at any point, even attack cancel, and if you want to preserve ammo, and you do want to preserve ammo, you'll need to learn attack patterns of the mobs, which can actually get quite complicated. If you get the system, melee becomes basically easy. But it is often of use to utilise firearms in combination with melee to optimize fighting. Some mobs are better suited to be dealt with a specific weapons. Line Figures are easily headshotted with a pistol, Nurses can be one-tapped with shotgun headshots, and so on.

Stomping is also back, you can still hit the mobs when they fall, or else they can get up immediately, though it also is contextual, which sometimes leads to funny results, like not being able to break a window near a lying enemy, or stomping air instead of enemy, or stomping the wrong guy. Also killed mobs can just get up because they like you that much - it seems their getting up is sometimes scripted, sometimes timed.

Another moment is that all areas are now more structurally formulaic. In each main area you have a Main Puzzle, usually covered with some rug to make the discovery more epic, I guess. It usually is a classic or modified classic recognizable puzzle or locked object, like the coin puzzle or multi-locked box. The entire area now circles around with a few routed sections during which you gather elements needed to solve or unlock the object. This is a functional approach, but it makes overall progression more predictable and formulaic, which is not a good thing for a horror experience. Luckily, this is compensated by diversity in structures and areas, with sub-puzzles, different monster compositions, and so on.

Returning to visuals, character modeling is the weakest part of the game. Not only some characters are weirdly disproportionate (especially Maria), their meshes seem to be in the need of an additional retouch to complete them. Angela's face seems to change from scene to scene, for example. Eddie is so grotesque, it seems he was made by the guys who worked on monsters, so he's pretty great. Laura looks like an overly eager potato, though. I won't say these character meshes are bad, they are perfectly serviceable, but the original and later SH3 were benchmarks of character modeling back at their time. SH2 original models did not stay as fresh as those in SH3, though.

Finally, overall playtime seems to be around 16 to 20 hours for an average playthrough, while the original was roughly half as long, and I'd say the remake would actually be better from cutting something like a quarter of it, probably creating some optional areas to inspect if you want, like police station in SH1. Game does drag a bit. I personally wasn't affected by it much, as usually all areas did pay off. But to each his own.

The game presented the thick, overwhelming atmosphere, slowly dawning on you to later give a slight release and roll back in full yet again. Foggy, dark, rusted, grated, fleshy and concrete, quiet and abandoned, the voyage is very true to the spirit of classic Silent Hill.

As for performance - I was among the lucky unaffected by stutters or crashes. No, I'm lying - it did crash once for me, and I also got stuck on level geometry once. That's the main technical issues I've got.

I can say that this is a good remake, made by people who knew what they were doing and actually did care about the original. However it is deeply flawed and has some fundamental problems. But the good points clearly far outweigh the negatives, Though the global asking price of $70 is clearly far too high.

I did enjoy the game tremendously, but it gave me essentially what I wanted. Results may vary for others."

Wake up people! This is a good game and it's free.
This is free content for the lovers of true ARPG games.
Probably the only free game where the microtransactions are purely for vanity items.

Try it and support it if you will enjoy it.

P.S. Don't get scared by the skill tree. Can be overwhelming but it makes sense!"
Path of Exile,238960,29667624,"Very good game.  Its free to play so how cann you go wrong.  Can get somewhat repetitive working your way through the acts multiple times.  

SMALL TIP FOR NEW PLAYERS:  Pay attention to your skill tree.  This is very important.  If your skill tree is not optimized properly towards what types of spells and attacks you plan on doing then you will not be able to defeat the higher tier enemys and end up grinding HARD.  Look up some good Path of Exile builds online or on youtube and follow those.

You will not just have one character.  And you will not play through the game just once.  Everytime becomes more of a challenge to better your character.

best diablo/hellgate mix that i have ever found! skilling is funny, you can almost do everything you want and even as free player you can reach good power level but well optic effects cost as usual. even high powered you will look like all the rest. everything special you got to buy with real money. but isnt that always the case?

NEGATIVE:

the quests become boring very fast, if you finished the first act you will fly over the others faster and faster until you encounter the point where you could NEED some other player to go with you. well...if nobody of your real life friends play this game you can forget it. in the community you wont find SOCIAL or FRIENDLY people. only egoistic and rude ones. 


its fun to play it solo still..you just need twenty hours more patience ;)

This is a great game. Try it out, its free anyway.

[h1]Review:[/h1]
Path of Exile is a ftp-Action_RPG game, released 2013 and being under continued development since then, having had multiple free expansions, leagues and content updates. It can be played solo or in a party with up to 5 other people on either soft- or hardcore.

[b]Pros:[/b]
-Free to Play, only cosmetical purchases
-dark & gritty style fitting the story and lore
-insanely deep and varied skill system
-smooth leveling experience
-expansive and challenging endgame
-interesting and unique currency and crafting system
-free trading economy
-seasonal leagues with their own twists and challenges to keep the game fresh
-regular free content patches
-big and friendly community
-around 5h of soundtrack
-nice looking cosmetical microtransactions

[b]Cons:[/b]
-this will eat your time
-start of play can be unimpressive
-since this is a always online game, connection issues can be a problem
-daunting skill tree
-through the leveling process you have to play the same story 3 times in increasing difficulty (changed in the future*)

*as of now, the new expansion ""Fall of Oriath"" has been announced for mid 2017, adding 6 new acts to the 4 existing ones, therefore eliminating the need to replay the story 3 times. (i have a boner)

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
For anyone interested in the action-rpg genre and disappointed by Diablo 3, look no further than this ftp-gem called Path of Exile. Challenging, rewarding and smooth to play, this appeals to everyone: the casual softcore to the min-maxing hardcore player. There is little as rewarding as building up your own character, theorycrafting, gearing, fighting, struggling and finally concquering everything the game has to offer. And then doing another one, thats complety different. And another one.
For someone new to the action-rpg genre, don't get scared by the seemingly endless possibilites and mechanics the game offers you, punch through the somewhat tedious first 2-3 hours of the game and enter the realm of the game that will suck you in and never let you out again.

Path of Exile,238960,29652666,"the best diablo2-clone on the market....well, actually it's free. A true f2p.

Path of Exile,238960,30043765,"It is rare to find a free to play game of anywhere near this scale where the pay-to-win factor is so committedly avoided. Having said that, some of the skins and cosmetics are absolutely worth having and the POE community are really responsive and supportive of new players too. Grinding Gear have remained true to their word over a long period of time to ensure wide access and a massive playing base. The skill tree and slot system for weapon improvement has been extraordinarily well-thought out. 

The ability for players to change direction of character development is really quite unparalleled and I can not recommend this game highly enough for balance, replayability and sheer addictive enjoyment. Having completed the game as a nimble (you gotta know how to dodge as some of those bosses hit HARD)  dps-focused hunter, I am going back to the beach with magic in my veins for a different challenge. This is a great game.."
Path of Exile,238960,29971132,"So you think this game is all about killing and looting just like any other ARPG. Well, yeah, there is tremendous amount of looting and killing in PoE, but really, really this game is about creating builds and see how it works.

You have to devour and digest enormous meta to fully enjoy this, and learning it is a part of the fun.

Huge passive tree, lots of active skills (gems), different ways of attack and defend, buffs and debuffs, type of weapons and magic, six classes each with 3 sub top classes and one class which is mix of all of them, and links and synergies between all this stuff. It all leads to literally endless variations how you can build your character and play it.

Oh, and this game is totally free. No content is hidden behind the paywall, you just pay for cosmetics and extra stash space which you need only if you love to collect all kind ot trash you'll never need.

So it's easy 10/10 for me, now I have to create another new character with this build idea I've just got."
Path of Exile,238960,30113475,"[h1]I don't have a lot of Hours on this, as I just started playing it through steam. I have been playing Path of Exile since June of 2012 http://i.imgur.com/jeP6URF.png and have thousands of hours on it.[/h1]

It is among the most amazingly awesome games I have ever played. Coming from Diablo 2: LoD, and the various mods (Valhalla, Eastern Sun, Median, etc) this game is perfect for me. 

* I will start here, with the things that I enjoy about it.

1. Diversity among builds. Want to shoot a thousand exploding arrows per second (Quill Rain + Chain/Greater Multiple Projectiles/Exploding Arrow/Fire Penetration)? Want to blast rays of fire that launch exploding balls of magma (Scorching Ray/Cast While Channeling/ Fire Penetration/ Multiple Projectiles/Magma Orb)? Want to call forth the fury of the heavens with a mighty scepter, smashing your foes into submission (Mjolnir+ Lightning Strike/Arc/StormCall/Spark/Multistrike)? The sheer amount of ways you can go about destroying mobs is limited only to your imagination. 

2. Story is great, very interestnig, and keeps you entertaining while playing through the game. Unlike other ARPGS of similar play style, Path of Exile is able to effectively deliver a quality story along with the extremely well done gameplay.

3. Scenery is dark and grim, gloomy, morbid, and full of gore. From corpse ridden beaches, ancient temples filled with undead and skeletons, destitute crumbling cities, palace cellars flooded with blood - ridden with heaps of corpses and twisted miscreations, echocing crystal caverns of golems and mutated freaks. The variety in enemies and terrain is very broad. 

4. Item creation, map alteration and creation, uber dungeons. There is plenty of challenge to be had in this game, thus keeping you striving to achieve ever greater power and push yourself ot the absolute limits of your capabilities.

5. Infinite replayablity. I have made probably 50+ characters so far, and each one gets progressively more powerful as I understand more about the game, the mechanics, and how to build them effectively. 

6. Temp Leagues + Ladder. Nuff said.

7. Constant expansion and content updates. The game is constantly being updated, minor balance tweaks, additional items, skills, monsters, maps, etc. It's amazing.

8. Grinding Gear Games are among the most amazing gaming company. Really really good people and they constantly interact and have dialogue with the playerbase. ""How do you guys feel about X? Does Y feel right to you? If you could change X, what would you do and why?"" etc.

[b]I could go on for another thousand lines but I feel as though I got the point across. The game is amazingly fun and addicting.[/b]

[h1]Now, for the things that, I don't necessarily ""dislike"" - but things that I feel may dissuade other people from playing the game.[/h1]

1. Learning Curve is incredibly steep. Your first 3-5 characters will be absolute trash. You need to do a bit of research on what to do and how to build effectively, otherwise you're probably going to get wrecked hard once you get to a4 merciless. Here is a beginners guide - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEZtq6FSebE&list=PLjlRwdIo6SixoG_Bo5bhKCzZtOMVuVnJZ&index=8&t=8s

2. Repetition of acts, 3 difficulties (however, this will be gone come July - TEN ACTS ONE PLAYTHROUGH HYPE!) Going from Normal, to Cruel, and then to Merciless can really put people off. Myself, I'm used to it and have done it since d2 so it's just a normal thing for the arpg genre. GGG are going to change that though.

3. Item crafting is [b]extremely[/b] expensive. Like, unfathomably expensive. I have never crafted an item before other than throwing an alch and a couple chaos into a rare item. 

4. Currency is nightmarishly rare. I've found maybe 4 exalted orbs in my entire time playing this game. Two of them were just within the last week as well. I have only ever owned two 6-link items. Wings of Entropy, and some random rare 2h sword that is garbage. 

5. poe.trade is the only real way to trade. $Chat is a scam 100% of the time. Once they implement a real trading system other than posting shops online and checking the forums every 3 minutes, or browsing poe.trade for an hour at a time trying to find an item to fill a hole in your build this game will be just shy of perfection.

Those are really the only negative things I can think of that might dissuade a player from sticking around... the game is magnificent.

I highly, highly suggest you play.

[h1]Overall Rating[h1]
[b]10/10 - one of my favorite games of all time.[/b]"
Path of Exile,238960,29758291,"Random Lazy Review (SP):

This game may be inspired heavily by diablo 2 but presented a pinnacle of greatness out of itself.

+ One handed easy to play isometric hack and slash worldwide standard.
+ Main storyline, missions are decent enough.
+ Every single game mechanic is perfected to the extremes.
+ Huge skill tree, interesting gem properties resulting in brilliant active skills.
+ Artistic/Graphical side and variety of characters, enemies, landscapes etc. are a sight for sore eyes


Some of minor issues ""for me"" which has no effect on the value fo the game:
- Where is the pause button? Respawning of monsters in a particular map whenever you are disconnected or hit esc to get a coffee. You have to go through everytime.
- Too much unecessary loot (little bugs droping heavy armours!).
- Countless of weapons which make no sense. (a common problem with diablo genre)

 Bottomline : Evil Blizzard's worst nightmare.

Recommend : Play it now.

And the best part is?  You don't even need to spend a dollar to thoroughly enjoy it.  It also runs anything variably better than a Raspberry Pi.

It's not pay to win, and it doesn't require you grind for 14 hours a day or keep playing regularly to keep/upgrade your stuff.

Path of Exile,238960,29614270,"It has been done. A better game than Diablo 2 has been created. I'm not going to argue with you about it. I was 13 when Diablo 2 came out, and I spent some of the best years of my life on that game. It invoked me with a sense of nostalgia that will, frankly, never fucking leave me. 

The official Diablo 3 - You are looking at it. When I first played this game, I said to myself ""This game is so similar to D2 that the devs are going to get sued!""

Jokes on me. This gave has (approximately) 25x (yes, 25x) as much content as D2. The crafting system puts every other game's system to shame.

Whatever. Take an oldschool D2 player's advice and DL the freaking game. It's free to play, pay to stash, but you start with plenty of stash tabs. Trust me brother, they get you *good and hooked* before you even think about spending a penny."

In those years I've seen that POE has had countless updates and content. It's really came into its own. I was tired of Diablo 3, and the developers decisions with it. I tried this game again and was amazed at how far its come, and how much it does right compared to Diablo 3. 

This game has incredible depth and unique varied RPG systems that makes leveling up really fun. You have the skill tree (similar to FFX) as you level. You also have skill gems and gem slots that allow you to add, remove, and mod skills with other skills. Its a very fun system. You can also level up those skills too. 

The gameplay is addicting and fun. Party up or solo its a great experience. Skills are unique and fun to use and mod, and the addition of 5 potion slots makes it even more vaied. 

The developers really know ARPG's. They listen to the community and make smart decisions with balance, gameplay, and how items/currency work. They give you plenty of freedom with items that can customize your gear so you have lots of room to make something you want work. Best ARPG I've ever played!"

Destiny 2,1085660,178167282,"Destiny 2 feels amazing to play, the gun-play is top notch, the build crafting is also pretty amazing. I find myself spending many hours outside the game researching builds and weapon combos. A lot of the game's activities are accessible very early into your journey, including the most recent expansion, the final shape, which is well written, very challenging and well worth the investment. 

The main downside to the game (personal opinion) is that its designed to appeal to players who want to log in daily, and a lot of the really fun and challenging activities are tied behind long, arduous grinds. Becoming high enough light level (in game recognition of your time spent) to do the best activities is ok, within reason. Destiny has an RNG based approach to gaining higher powered gear, and it can often mean spending a lot of time to earn gear which will drop in a slot you already have at that level.

I will often say to my friends this is one of the best feeling and looking games, weighed down by some design choices that really hurt new and more casual players.

From my personal experience, Destiny is an amazing game, until you get bogged down in the roots of it. Play it casually and you will come back fresh each time, enjoy your experience and be able to move on when needed. Take it too seriously and chances are you will be frustrated."
Destiny 2,1085660,177556931,"I've been playing Destiny going on Ten Years now.   I've been around since the beginning of D1 through the horrible DLCS, around for the better ones (Oryx <3).  After that I was ready to pickup D2 as soon as it released. Yes, it has been long and winding and arduous with all of the changes, and content and nerfs and buffs and balancing and it really never ends. This game isn't just a game to grind though. I've made and lost countless friends, raided with people from around the world, saw the culmination of TEN YEARS of story with my best friend who I still play with to this day. Yes, you can play the numbers and make yourself the most efficient killing machine, but you can also have those moments that only games like Halo had brought previously.  Hilarious deaths that should never have happened because you got WAAAYYY to carried away with a heavy grenade launcher.  Rage moments because today isn't your day for PVP but your fire team is just happy you can get on to play.  I've killed gods and seen warlords fall, I have traveled through countless iterations of reality in search of a fabled hero who's name was only mentioned in the fables of old.  We felled the TAKEN KING, the EMPEROR OF THE CABAL EMPIRE, and the Vex keeper of TIME ITSELF and battled our way out of the clutches of THE WITCH QUEEN.  I have yet to fell THE WITNESS, but it's definitely on my list.  If you want an experience of forging your own story, Destiny 2 is the right game.  Even if it shut down tomorrow, the experiences that I've had exploring this shared universe will be something I will be able to talk about well after it's gone with the people that shared the journey along the way.

The main saga between the light and darkness that started back in 2014 is completed and the game is currently struggling trying to keep players. The micro-transactions are ridiculous and overpriced, they keep increasing prices and have just released a mobile game instead of focusing on this or marathon. There's no incentive to join the game as a new player other than trying old content (Much of which has been removed that people have payed for) and there's is nothing for old players to do other than the same copy, paste events every year.

Destiny 2,1085660,177303540,"TL;DR
I don't recommend this game unless you are willing to walk on broken glass for a hundred hours before getting to the good part. If you get past that there is plenty of content to enjoy(hoping they don't delete years of it) and a great core gameplay loop. Having faith that Bungie will improve on this game is a gamble so if you expect anything from them you will likely be disappointed.

Although Destiny is the best looter shooter to ever exist, I cannot recommend it someone unless I know they are willing to put up with a ton of slop. I'll start with the positives. Destiny has some of the best gunplay in the industry combined with a very fun to use ability system. The lore of the game is also great if you are able to separate it from the story that is portrayed in the game itself. I can't understate how strong the core gameplay loop is but almost everything else sucks. The game is very expensive to get into. Bungie expects new players to drop a ton of money in order to get into the game even though it is advertised as free to play. In reality there is a free demo that contains minimal amounts of content and the content that is present is often overlooked by Bungie because they can't profit off of it. If you are willing to drop a hundred dollars or more to get into the game then you will be greeted by one of the worst new player experiences ever crafted. You will either be forced to sit through cutscenes and loaded into missions unexpectedly or be given zero guidance on how to engage with the game and be forced to rely on youtubers or friends to guide you. The quality of expansions and seasonal content is shaky at best so if you end up preordering you will be disappointed half the time. As Bungie had been ramping up the cost of the game over the past few years players hoped that these funds would be reinvested into the game or perhaps a Destiny 3. As it turns out, they put all this money into other projects that spectacularly failed sending hundreds of millions of Destiny's money down the drain. If you can overlook all of these flaws and many more then maybe consider trying out the game."
Destiny 2,1085660,177288480,Game used to be fun.  Then they started making all of the new content difficult for the sake of pleasing hardcore players rather than the casual players who keep the game up and running.  The latest dungeon was an absolute shit show that I didn't bother finishing because the bosses are overtuned to the highest level equipment and take over a dozen damage phases to kill if you're just going in to have fun.  I am disappointed in how they're slowly killing off the game's playerbase with high difficulty base content.  The game is no longer fun to just play the way you want to.  And I'm never giving Bungie my money again.
Destiny 2,1085660,177958349,"I recommend this for those who've played 50% of the entire franchise. From Destiny 1 to Destiny 2 now. Especially those heavily into the lore. For those who wish to join now, in today's age; pass on this. It looks free, but is riddled with thousands of purchases here and there for crucial access to essential story access.

The game, with full understanding of its mechanics, lore, and story, is a solid 8/10. Without it, don't bother. This game started in 2014, and if you weren't there, it's not for you.

TLDR: This game is not made for new players."
Destiny 2,1085660,178014596,"If you want to play a game which is consistently broken, extremely bad online game play, 0 updates to their PvP game modes(which are a cancer due to the way the game is structured), and you want to spend 12x a normal games cost then this is the game for you.

Destiny 2,1085660,177452550,Terrible dont buy this game. There is a quest that you have to complete to journey farther into the game end game stuff but theres a bug and it's been known about for around 4-5 weeks. dont spend money on this game.
Destiny 2,1085660,178851497,the game has gone to crap and is full of bugs that bungie refuses to fix.
Destiny 2,1085660,178744539,"Extremely confusing menu, quests, timelines, npcs in stories are alive and dead at the same time. Can't tell what you should be after. What are our weekly and daily quests? Most parts of the game are locked and seems each part is locked behind another 50ish euros ""old"" content. Gearing system is a mess, since leveling your weapons and armor is not explained. Sometimes your gear level matters and sometimes you get lowered to match some activities. Could be some system behind it but there are NO INSTRUCTIONS for anything in this game. Some quests are open, some locked but cant tell what is what, since the menu is a mess. Is there a main quest line? An efficient way to level? Will neven know. Most confusing game so far on steam
Forgot to mention i bought the latest ""expansion"" The final shape. Waste of 50 euros"

Destiny 2,1085660,178462985,"I wish this game would die already, I swear everyone that plays this game is a ""Know It All"" or acts like a ""Know It All""
Plus who can forget about the Abhorrent amount of FOMO from each season. Lets not forget about the mobile game, which has better supers then this.     Honestly if you have friends that play this game, Get New Friends. The raids are the only good part of the game.

Black Desert,582660,178285753,"An interesting if quickly repetitive canned-animation-combat system build on the grindiest afk-to-progress pseudo-MMO around.

It looks amazing with settings ramped up but optimisation has remained an issue since launch.
The world is huge and believable but you only end up going to specific locations to farm and place alts on the various other locations of note (world-boss-spawns, key interactables, seasonal event locations).
There's in theory ""forces PvP flagging"" after you hit ""midgame"" (you can't unlock your bonus weapon without allowing/opting yourself to PvP flag in certain areas/environments from that point on with that character but the PvP is entirely about hard-counters, level discrepancies and gear-score so if someone decides to engage you to kick you off a farm-spot you will simply die without presenting the merest hint of a challenge. 

Core gameplay is grinding the 1-2 spots optimal for massed trash-drops (vendored for money), xp and certain quest/artifact/crafting/enhancement drops.
Gear progression is 1-15+5 armour/weapon levels that can downgrade/break when you inevitably fail (there's P2W and in-game purchasable items to prevent the downgrade), jewelry goes to +5 but it is simply destroyed on failure. Upgrades fundamentally are about ""stacking failures"" to upgrade cheap items so you can apply that bonus/multiplier to the item you actually want to improve, it's exactly as obnoxious as it sounds and even the introduction of a pity-system for failed upgrades isn't quite enough given the general aquisition rate of upgrade mats for anyone who doesn't live in the game or play the market 24/7 (not that there's much to sell anymore, the market's flush with years worth of accumulated tradeskilling/farming thou sales only last 30 days iirc) the most profitable item at this point seems to be wood and stone, 2 items that can't be afk-farmed.

The story tries but it's hours of stilted dialogue sometimes 5-10 minutes of exposition between hand-ins. 

Ultimately it's a game that utterly fails to respect your time despite having a whole heap of fairly interesting sounding features and a remarkably wide array of classes.

Despite my playtime i have mostly afk'd the game for trade-skilling/farming/daily-login-timers. My Characters remain pitifully weak due to simple terrible luck with upgrades."
Black Desert,582660,177546456,"With hundreds of hours of gameplay invested in this MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online), I can say that “Black Desert” offers a unique and immersive experience, but not without challenges and controversies.

Strengths

1. Graphics and Art Design:
One of the most obvious strengths of “Black Desert” is its exceptional graphics. The graphics engine was developed by Pearl Abyss and allows for incredible detail of the environment, characters, and animations. The landscapes are stunning, from sunny beaches and dense forests to elaborate cities, with every detail contributing to the creation of an immersive world. The character customization features are among the most advanced in the industry, giving players the ability to create unique characters with fine detail.

2. Dynamic Combat System:
The combat system in “Black Desert” is one of the most captivating aspects of the game. Unlike many traditional MMOs that use a tab-based system, BDO adopts a real-time combat system, allowing players to execute combinations of attacks, abilities, and escapes. This approach gives the game tactical depth, requires a certain degree of dexterity, and makes confrontations more interesting. Each class has a distinct fighting style, and the ability to switch between available classes adds a nice variety.

3. Activities and Economy:
“Black Desert” is not just a fighting game; it offers a wide range of extracurricular activities. From fishing and farming to trading and crafting, the game allows players to engage in various economic activities. The economy system is complex and interconnected, and players can take advantage of trade opportunities to build their wealth. Crafting activities, in particular, are well-developed, and obtaining the materials needed to create rare items can be an exciting challenge.

4. Community and Events:
The community in “Black Desert” is diverse and active, with numerous guilds and groups organizing events. The game also benefits from seasonal events and frequent updates, which bring new content and challenges. This interaction with other players contributes to a sense of belonging and brings an important social dimension to the game.

Weaknesses

1. Steep Learning Curve:
One of the main drawbacks of “Black Desert” is its steep learning curve. At first, the game can seem overwhelming due to the complex systems and multiple options available. The combat mechanics, economy, and character progression take time to master, and new players may feel lost without proper guidance.

2. Grinding Issues:
While there is a variety of activities available, some players may find the excessive grinding required for progression frustrating. Increasing experience levels, obtaining rare equipment, and developing skills require significant playtime. This can make the game feel repetitive in the long run, especially for those who don’t enjoy the side activities.

3. Microtransactions:
Another controversial aspect is the implementation of microtransactions. While the game is free to play, there are payment options for various items and perks, which can create a “pay-to-win” feeling for some players. This has drawn criticism from the community, especially for those who don’t want to invest additional money in the game.

Conclusion
“Black Desert Online” is a game that brings together spectacular graphics, a dynamic combat system, and a wide range of activities. However, the steep learning curve and potential grind may discourage some players. With an active community and regular events, BDO offers a robust and engaging MMO experience, but it requires time and effort to be fully appreciated."
Black Desert,582660,177893557,"the combat is flashy but doesn't actually seem interesting

the story is boring, and I don't care about the quests as I do them

from what I've seen and experienced so far, the game is very grindy--which would be fine if I had something to grind for. there isn't, and it's just a waste of time"
Black Desert,582660,178715403,"This company has gone down hill really bad. this game was so good, but they killed it. there is no point of playing it anymore. The devs never listen. This game has the most if not best combat in any mmo, yet there is no PVP they killed it. their greed lead them to their own demise. Do not play this game. I do not recommend it, you will not have a great time and you'll just waste your time."
Black Desert,582660,177864867,best price i have ever paid 0.89p wow had little problem at start making menus larger did that only been playing for a few hours so far and i am loving this game and many hours of fun still to cum and its not hard that hard at all with key bored and mouse give it ago reviews down size the game i think its beautiful so far
Black Desert,582660,178728705,"wake up as a weird looking mage, burn everything in the forest, burn everything infront of the villages, burn the village if you are able, kill demons and op creatures and monster, discover the ruins and the secrets of the world just to become a fisherman"
Black Desert,582660,178027534,"Not bad for an MMO, but uses aggressive and unnecessary DRM.

If you want to play it, contact the developer and ask them to remove the DRM."
Black Desert,582660,178681624,"I would recommend this game but honestly it's quite overwhelming. Too many icons and things happening at the same time There's  main quest and then suddenly 300 quests out of nowhere for god knows what...I hope the devs know people are not going to read every single one of them or the dialogues with the npcs..and then the deals of the week , then wheel of knows what and then the stone of God something and let's not forget the 600 notifcations nobody cares about you can't turn off...almost dare I say like a casino. A bit predatory.
Good game but too much stuff thrown at you. It's a game you play for a week ,you get tired and you pick it up again after a year because you're bored. And the cycle repeats."
Black Desert,582660,178213687,"if game crashes and or launcher turns white get rid of game asap, i can't even play the game and it broke my graphics card, i had to ask for a refund and delete the game"
Black Desert,582660,178712722,"This game become a piece of trash, nothing is clear, absolute miserable UI and cluttered, no way to get gear if you didn't play for a long time, game economy is miserable and the piece of resistance its a farming fest."
Black Desert,582660,178117382,"[h1] An MMO That Sets the Bar [/h1]

[i] As a long-time MMO fan, I had Black Desert on my radar even before its release, and it has more than delivered. With over 1000 hours of playtime, I can confidently say it's one of the best MMOs out there. [/i]

[hr][/hr]

[h2] Combat That Stands Out [/h2]

[b]Hands down, the best combat system in the genre.[/b] The action-combat style is fluid, intense, and extremely satisfying. Every class feels unique, and mastering combos really makes a difference. Unlike the traditional tab-targeting system found in many MMOs, Black Desert’s combat is skill-based and adds a huge layer of excitement to every fight.

[hr][/hr]

[h2] RNG - Love It or Hate It [/h2]

[u]I personally love the RNG in Black Desert[/u]. Yes, it's brutal and can be punishing, but that’s also what makes it so rewarding when you finally succeed. You’re always on the edge, hoping for that big moment, and that anticipation keeps me coming back. [spoiler]For some, the RNG might be too frustrating, but I think it adds a unique thrill that’s missing in other MMOs.[/spoiler]

[hr][/hr]

[h2] P2W? Not Really. [/h2]

This is one of the most debated points about Black Desert. For me, it's [u]not pay-to-win[/u]. Sure, spending money can speed things up, but even with a big wallet, the RNG aspect means there's no guaranteed advantage. To actually have a significant edge, you’d need to spend ridiculous amounts of cash—far more than most players would ever consider. [b]It’s all about commitment and patience here.[/b]

[hr][/hr]

[h2] AFK Progress - For Busy Gamers [/h2]

Black Desert offers a lot of semi-AFK or fully AFK progression options, which is a huge plus. From fishing to trading and more, you can still make meaningful progress when you're away from the screen. It’s one of the few games where I feel productive even when I’m logged out, which is perfect for someone with a busy schedule.

[hr][/hr]

[h3] Final Thoughts [/h3]

If you're into MMOs, Black Desert is worth every minute. It's challenging, rewarding, and always keeps you on your toes. The grind is real, but so are the rewards. Highly recommended!

Black Desert,582660,178769183,the combat system was great I very much enjoyed the fighting style of the ranged class
Black Desert,582660,178673754,Good combat system but its too easy sometimes. Very grindy for lifeskills. Sometimes not enough storage for items. Over all a 7/10 game
Black Desert,582660,177201539,"They really do their best to make sure I can't play the game. First, there's some weird problem where I set the resolution as 3440x1440 (my monitors resolution) and it just doesn't change in some menus? Then there's the absolute dogshit anti-aliasing, which mixed with the weird ass resolutions makes the text unreadable at reasonable ui sizes. It also just crashes occasionally and refuses to boot up at all after I installed an update?
I loved the combat, the character creation was insanely detailed and its got a decently pretty environment (when you ignore the anti aliasing) but I've just had too many problems with bugs and outdated graphics dressing up in a trench coat to sneak onto my pc together.
Like a third of my playtime is me trying to finagle settings to make this game look like the modern game it is and I was wholly unsuccessful. I would say thank god that I got this game for free but I could of been doing a lot more useful things with my time than dealing with this game's shit."
Black Desert,582660,177241079,"Con mas de 37000 horas de juego, la ganancia que haces grindeando no se ve reflejada a la hora de mejorar equipo, puedes invertir 200 horas de grindeo para que al final solo aumente tu daño en 1 punto, ademas el RNG aunque tengas 99.9% te falla el 101% de las veces que intentes mejorar algo."

Black Desert,582660,177831395,Honestly the combat system is a little strange but you get used to it. Other than that i really have no complaints so far. I've been looking for a game to play exactly like this and i have to say it delivered
Black Desert,582660,178802499,Waste of time. Can get the game to display in English while I live in Japan. Waste of time.
Black Desert,582660,178839596,"The controls are hard to get used to if you have trouble clicking or using your mouse to see. The combat is just grinding mobs. Exp from quests is low. To click anything with the mouse you use ""CTRL"" then after you use your mouse you have to click CTRL again. There are NO hotbars if you are used to WoW or FF14 type play. The user interface is confusing for new players. 
What got me to play was the story. But after a while I found myself running from person to person just to tell them something that did not progress the story. I tried this game on console and it is NOT CONSOLE FRIENDLY. What I don't like is feeling like I don't understand the controls and I'm just button mashing. I don't like the UI, no hotbars, keybinds confusing, and feeling like I am not progressing by running everywhere. Granted there is a T button that auto-moves you to the next person to talk to. 
Again for me its the camera and UI set up."

DayZ,221100,176936474,"This game is fun but if you have no friends that play it gets pretty boring when you try to survive and only have your mind to talk to, endlessly thinking and going slowly insane. but i think this game is fun for people who have people to play with."
DayZ,221100,177110733,"Going to preface this by saying I actually like the game, its complicated and very enjoyable because of it. However, the Devs are so amateur that this game can seem like something that is being made by teenagers in a hichschool comp sci lab. The new DLC broke the game again in the exact same way as Livonia did when it came out, how the hell have they not figured this out after it already happened with the last DLC? I am honestly having a hard time giving the devs the benefit of the doubt after the stunt they pulled on mod makers. If a dev team is embarrassed by a modder fixing a known issue that has been publicly complained about for years now instead of being grateful then maybe they shouldn't be devs. Honestly, if a modder can make you look bad as a dev, you are a bad dev and deserve to look bad."
DayZ,221100,177145747,"The recent update, gives us alot to think about the future of DayZ. They announced the new map/dlc in April.
They went full marketing with teasers, streams etc.

Yet on release day, they can't get their official servers to run and even community servers were up and running hours before official. Community did not have access to the files before launch day! Community servers are your backbone Bohemia!!! Without community servers your game is dead, because official is full of cheater clans, yes clans not singular players, full on organized cheater clans.

Then they messed up their own launcher to the point people who didn't buy the DLC couldn't even log into a Chernarus server. And people who bought the DLC couldn't get onto official servers. 

Then, they released patch notes, for an update they've been building for 6 months (SIX MONTHS) that has dozens of lines of known problems already that will be ""investigated and patched in a later update"".

Get real Bohemia, stop giving us new content if that means old content will be unplayble. FIX YOUR SH*T!"
DayZ,221100,177208640,"Love it, hate it... toxic players... but still the best Zombie Survival game there is ... well arma 2 dayz mod was better IMHO!!! to fully enjoy the game as a casual gamer  go for private/community servers"
DayZ,221100,177414675,"This game can be quite amazing.  Love just wandering the wilds looting and surviving from what ever the server throws at me.  Building your base where ever you want is so awesome and I love building especially with the building mods. It can be quite clunky, but no where near the clunky disaster arma is.  I only play the PvE servers since players can be quite toxic.  Honestly the best way to experience Dayz is the custom servers.  So much content made by amazing people.

 Setting up your own server really shouldnt be as complicated and time consuming as it is.. it should be as simple as project zomboid but its a million miles from that.. spend hours upon hours copy and pasting codes into hopefully the correct spot only to start everything up and now no zombies spawn... its honestly pretty stupid and cudos to the people that set servers up.  Setting up a server, especially a lan server, should be as easy as joining a server with mods.  Seriously, pz nails it.

BI should consider hiring the modders that have created so much for this game and fixed SO many problems the devs have created.  So many maps released over the years, so much content, all by modders.  The devs go and release a single map dlc and it breaks the entire game for the people that play on community servers and dont want to buy frostline(Ive played namalsk, im good).  They really seems like they have no idea what theyre doing.  The game also is over priced so wait for a sale

5/5 game but it just suffers from a poor engine and dev team.  The community keeps the game held high"
DayZ,221100,178156501,"I thought I'd be chilling in the wilderness, making a fire, cooking beans and maybe chatting up the occasional survivor. Yeah no. About five minutes in I'm crouched in a pitch-black building holding a knife like it's Excalibur while some zombie horde claw at the door like I owe them money.

The scenery? Beautiful. The atmosphere? Immersive. The game? Pure panic disguised as survival. I love it and hate it in equal measure - half the time I'm sneaking around like a terrified racoon jumping at every twig snap, the other half I'm jumped by other players and wondering why I thought I'd make it out alive.

So here's the catch: don't get attached to anything. Not your character, not your stuff or the friendly stranger you split beans with. Honestly, I've learned to say goodbye the moment I spawn."
DayZ,221100,177107588,"i feel dumb because im only realizing how feeble\stupid it is to get paid DLC for a game i have to use several GB's of mods just to make playable in the first place......this would be like giving a bonus to a contractor who left a hole in the side of your house and offers to fix it for a additional 25.99$----if that seems like sound logic to you, then youll understand why people make fun of the public school system in the u.s."
DayZ,221100,178608560,"i really like this game but why cant we play a friends only or offline mode? 
i want to enjoy the building etc part of the game, and as a casual player, i cant because everyone always ends up killing me and after i get completely lost and lose all my progress, i understand thats part of the game but an offline mode or friends only mode would provide a learning curve aswel as people like me enjoying the games building side of things, hunting, getting cars to work etc... 
i hate the fact if your new here, you have a HUGE disadvantage... 
i like the game but i donno if ill be buying any dlcs etc for it.. its annoying me already.."
DayZ,221100,177156514,"Yeah, this update stinks. F*cked over community servers, that have carefully crafted their mods and adjustments. Alot of stuff is reset. Probably takes 100+ hours to fix. Get rekt Bohemia, you are killing your base right now while catering to the casuals that will be gone next month out of boredom."
DayZ,221100,177857539,"It genuinely pains me to NOT recommend this game to new players as obviously I have spent a lot of time playing this game and probably will continue to. I love this game, but cannot recommend to a new player because half of the time I hate it just as much, and I don't really think the reward is worth the suffering you have to endure to have an actual enjoyable experience on it. I'll summarize my thoughts on this game in 3 main points, one good, one bad, and one neutral.

1: Time (Neutral)
DayZ is not a game to play after work or school or if you have any obligation that day whatsoever. When you play this game, get ready to dedicate 2 hours just to finding a good server and meeting up with your friends so you can actually start doing something 'fun'. That's if you're lucky and don't die in the process. Sure, you can play a modded server with infinite sprint. a group system and a map, but then everybody on the server groups up in huge clans, and run in packs from each military base. It ruins the fundamentals of the game which are built on exploration, curiosity, and desperation. DayZ is all about the journey, and the friends you make along the way. If you're playing this game to run around and shoot people, you can do that. It would probably just be more fun on Tarkov or Warzone. There is NO instant gratification in this game. Everything you have to earn, and everything WILL be lost eventually. This game will constantly leave you feeling like you just haven't had enough, either by being so fun and exciting that you don't ever want to play any other game again, or by being so broken and unfulfilling that it sucks you in looking for that excitement it once gave you, only to chew you up and spit you out at the end wondering where the previous 12 hours went.

2: Fear adrenaline, trauma, and bonding (Good)
DayZ has always done one thing right, and for awhile, it was the only non horror game capable of evoking this genuine fear, and in some respects, it still is. It's not just fear in the sense that you don't want the scary monster to appear on the screen, it's an actual fear of loss. The more time you spend alive, the more you feel like you should be dead, and it's almost a breath of fresh air to respawn on the coast because you don't have to carry the burden of your gear on your shoulders anymore. You are always a target to other players, and you become so scared, other players are always a target to you. Sometimes, and I mean sometimes, someone will miss a shot or run out of ammo or get knocked unconscious instead of dying, and in those instances, you have a chance to use your voice chat and make a friend! Just remember, at the end of the day, everyone wants their life to last longer than yours. Trust nobody, until you do. This would be a stronger point and would be THE ONLY GOOD REASON to buy and play DayZ if you haven't already, but, It's just not a good enough reason by todays' standards in gaming. With so many popular survival, battle royale and extraction shooters out nowadays, such as Escape from Tarkov, Hunt: Showdown, Rust, Project Zomboid, Stalker, Etc. There is sadly, becoming less of a need for DayZ, with newer, more polished games coming out that evoke the same feeling that Dayz does. Not to mention the Arma: Reforger DayZ mod which I believe has lots of potential to be a better Dayz experience than the standalone game if given some time. This leads me to my next point;

3: Performance (bad)
This game runs like shit, and it's aging poorly. I have a 4070, 12600k, 32gb of DDR4 4000, and an SSD and this game still has constant hitches, stutters, freezes, and crashes after YEARS of support and updates. It's genuinely unacceptable how badly optimized this game is, and how little effort the devs put in to making it more stable. There have been false promises for stability patches for YEARS, but I given up hope on ever being able to run the game smoothly. I have done months worth of research to pinpoint the reason, I've upgraded my PC, tried a completely different PC, new monitors, adjusted my mouse polling rate, tinkered with the cfg file and shortened my render distance, etc. etc. etc. Nothing works. For awhile, I had convinced myself that there was some setting I was missing, that if I just put in a little more time optimizing my PC or if I bought a newer, better part the game would finally run well. I am here to warn any potential new player once and for all; this game runs like HOT GARBAGE and it always will. Expect to lose progress to glitches and crashes that aren't your fault, expect your time to feel wasted. It's going to happen.

In summary, I can't recommend DayZ to a new player because personally, I just have not gotten back what I've put into this game, and it's very disappointing. I RELUCTANTLY DO NOT RECOMMEND DAYZ, but do recommend Escape from Tarkov or the DayZ Arma mod if you want the same experience. DayZ started something great, it's just not that great anymore. :("

DayZ,221100,178585017,"The survival experience at the heart of the game is a compelling journey with challenges and depth that can be incredibly fulfilling. However, problems that affect both official and community servers constantly erode this potential, making the whole experience frustrating for many players.

On [b]official servers[/b], cheaters are a common issue that detracts from what should be an engaging and competitive gaming experience. Because of the seemingly nonexistent efforts to prevent cheating, players are left vulnerable, which frequently prompts them to seek safety on community servers. Unfortunately, these servers are not the ideal haven that many people seek. While they may promise enhanced rule sets and improved moderation, many fail to deliver on this promise due to their own shortcomings.

Owners and their administrative teams often display toxic behaviour, which taints [b]community servers[/b]. Power abuse is widespread, with many players receiving unjust punishments or even community bans for subjective or minor infractions. A hostile and erratic experience that can equal or even surpass the problems encountered on official servers is produced by this toxic culture.

Ultimately, these structural issues frequently overshadow the attractive survival landscape and interesting mechanics. Players find it challenging to fully enjoy what the game has to offer because of the dominance of cheaters, the toxic behaviour of many server owners, and the uneven moderation, which creates an environment that falls short of its potential."

Now the latest update won't even allow me to open the game with my Intel graphics card. Almost $30 on the campaign is now wasted. Disgraceful"
Halo Infinite,1240440,177672245,"TLDR; game's fun, I'd play campaign again especially with friends. Multiplayer has genuine issues that people seem to either vehemently hate or completely ignore or even defend. This game is a testament to corporations' fetishes for infinite (heh) growth infesting and profiteering on something as simple as games.

===========================

Oof first Halo game I actually didn't like. Don't get me wrong, the campaign is fun and the forge tools are bonkers, but 343 really pulled out the thesis in ""how to kill a multiplayer fanbase"" on this one and pulled it out fast. A live-service game (supposedly) where they add maps every few months (usually made by the community), add new game types every year, and add.... 1 weapon over the course of the game's lifecycle.

The multiplayer is fun at first, but damn if the SBMM sucks. SBMM gets a bad rap because people at the top of the leaderboards complain and lackeys parrot the message, but in this game it truly does suck. You do well one match only to get paired with a braindead team as ""the best player"" on your side and are matched against a party that pubstomps. Get one match 30-and-0 only to go 2-and-10 the next feels just old and tired after a while. I can't even play with friends because we'll get matched with people on my level and they go zilch the whole game.

And for real, can we put the KBM/controller conversation to bed? It took 343 over a year to fix the KBM support, and yet surprise surprise, a game that incentivizes keeping crosshairs on an enemy due to longer TTK would be easier on a controller with aim assist. Is it as night-and-day as everyone says? No, not at all. But anyone who tries to say it doesn't exist is either baiting or hasn't actually tried both methods. Some weapons just feel absolutely terrible on KBM (looking at you, stalker rifle). What's worse is the main tactic to avoid gunfire is quick-strafing, which does nothing for controller players and is significantly harder to deal with on KBM. It's worse than other Halos because, for some reason, 343 turned up the acceleration to high heaven. 343 just never had to deal with this before because they only made console games and had 3rd parties port everything for them. No wonder why Master Chief Collection feels so much better, they outsourced it to competent devs.

And all the dick-riding justifying the microtransactions is tiresome, honestly. Are people not realizing it's 20-fucking-dollars for a single skin? Can people not realize the campaign costs $60? They're not really 'micro' when a single set can cost 1/3 the price of the full game. Heck, some are half the price! LASO, let alone Legendary, didn't even give you any reward! Nothing. All you got was ""red and green"" skins for finding boxes in the campaign. People are really rationalizing ""they have to make money to keep the lights on"" when deadass they have peanuts to show for it in terms of reinvesting into the live-service model. Passes that you can buy for playing the previous? Gone. Now we get a bunch of credits and 1 armor set every couple of weeks with obviously cooler ones in the cash shop. Goodbye weekly ultimate rewards, hello 1K good boy points.

The one positive I will say is that you can still at least earn enough in the passes that still exist to buy all the older ones. That's a genuinely appreciated system that was very fresh and pro-consumer for its time and popular enough that other companies started to adopt it as well.

I would bandwagon and say ""give Halo back to Bungie!"" but Jesus, do people not realize they're just as bad? At least here people aren't brainwashed into spending as much money as some people do in Destiny yeesh. But people will still defend this type of money-grubbing behavior while a corporation laughs that it doesn't need to justify scummy practices. I want to go back to when Halo 3 was new and infinite growth hadn't yet infected games."

Halo Infinite,1240440,178602613,"To be honest, the only reason I don't recommend this is because its still a buggy piece of crap. They either don't know how, or refuse to fix this issue. I know its small but I hate having to restart the freaking game to keep playing after 3 or 5 matches. Buy on sale if you really want the story mode, its not bad but not worth what they want for it. Its Halo so you know, you either hate it and all its bugs or you love it and all its bugs. Gotta say though, Halo Reach will always be the best Halo ever made in my opinion. Also gotta say, not having Invasion in the game is kinda meh. With the business model they have you would think that Brute and Elite armor cores would be in the game but alas, tis not. There was also a lot of stuff missing at launch, still is. I don't know about others but this release the game in beta and we will fix it later (maybe) bs is getting old."
Halo Infinite,1240440,178517255,"It was fun for a little while, but it quickly reminded me that the older games were just... better.  I can't blame any particular part of this game for being the root cause of me not liking it, it's just all wrong for me as a player.  Vehicles are floaty and weak, the guns are OK, Forge is awesome no complaints there, but the whole thing is just off.

As an addendum to my review, I cannot play Infinite anymore on my current system.  It'll load about one-third of the way and then the game locks-up and I have to end it in task manager.  I think this has to do with me re-installing it on my external HDD, but I have bigger games on my HDD that load just fine, if a lot more slowly."
Halo Infinite,1240440,178414052,"What started out as a fun sandbox has been kicked into the ground by 343's mismanagement. Historically Spartan customization was one of the driving points to keep playing, whether it was game time to unlock pieces or credits to grind in reach. They've decided the only thing you get now is shoddy pieces off of mind numbing battle passes and then anything properly cool is stuck behind your wallet.

Play it for customs, if it's on sale get the campaign (fun gameplay, low mid story). Do not engage with it otherwise. If they fix it, the review will change. But since launch they've done nothing but double down on greedy decisions.

If you want good Halo, play Master Chief collection. You'll get steam workshop on top of it."

Red Dead Redemption 2,1174180,178708752,"This review reflects my personal feelings as a player who hasn’t played the first Red Dead Redemption game and didn’t have any expectations going in. The game is quite long in terms of story, taking me around 75 hours to complete, but I don’t regret a single hour spent. This game is absolutely worth it. Here are my thoughts on the main aspects of the game:

1. STORY
The story in Red Dead Redemption 2 is long, gripping, and full of twists, taking me about 75 hours to complete. Each chapter brings something new, keeping the experience fresh and engaging. The plot introduces us to a wide range of characters, each with their own personalities and backgrounds, which gives the story depth but also requires careful attention. There are so many characters to keep track of that it’s essential to pay attention to their roles, as some names can easily start to blend together. Watching Arthur Morgan, the main protagonist, navigate complex relationships and situations was one of the best parts of the story. This journey is full of emotional moments, unexpected turns, and intense scenes that kept me hooked from beginning to end.

2. GAMEPLAY
The gameplay is incredibly smooth, with a wide selection of weapons to choose from, ranging from revolvers and rifles to bows. The controls feel responsive, and exploring the vast open world is satisfying and immersive. There’s a realistic sense of variety in what you can do—from hunting animals to discovering random camps and visiting bustling towns. The world feels alive with details, like diverse animals to hunt, items to sell, and dynamic weather and landscapes.
One good feature is the crafting system, where you can create your own specialized ammunition, like fire arrows and explosive bullets, as well as health items to aid you in survival. This adds another layer of customization to how you approach different situations and fights. One small downside, however, is the horseback riding, which can be a bit clunky. Sometimes the horse changes direction unexpectedly or trips over small objects instead of leaping over them. Despite this, the gameplay is highly enjoyable and full of options that make every hour in the game worthwhile.

3. GRAPHICS
I have never played a game that is so graphically and visually detailed. Even though the game has been out for a few years, it still looks better than many newer games. I often spent hours just walking through forests, watching or hunting animals, and admiring the beautiful scenery. The environments, weather effects, and character animations are breathtakingly realistic, making the game feel immersive.

4. ACHIEVEMENTS
I love collecting achievements in games, and because Red Dead Redemption 2 is such an excellent game, I aimed to get as many achievements as possible. With so many types of animals, it took me dozens of hours to track, study, and skin them all to earn certain achievements. Even though these achievements took a long time to complete, I enjoyed every moment. However, there are a few achievements that are simply grindy rather than challenging or fun. For example, the story mode has an achievement that requires you to kill and skin 16 bears, which becomes more of a tedious task. The online achievements have similar issues, like needing to own five horses, which costs around $2,500 in-game currency. Given that missions only reward around $20 each, this achievement can be frustratingly grindy.

5. ONLINE MODE
The online mode is disappointing, which isn’t surprising considering Rockstar’s history with online games. Missions are repetitive, and high-level players often target new, low-level players, making the experience frustrating. Additionally, the servers are unstable, and the game crashes frequently. In my opinion, Red Dead Redemption 2 Online is a failed addition to an otherwise amazing game.

FINAL THOUGHTS
In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed playing Red Dead Redemption 2. The story, gameplay, graphics, and achievements (despite a few frustrations) make it an outstanding game. Though the online mode was disappointing, the single-player experience alone is well worth it.

Thank Goodness You’re Here!,2366980,176987210,"Mistakenly turning off subtitles and only understanding half of what is said is the best way to experience this amazing game. I've never laughed out loud from a video game and this one had me rolling. 10/10, I need the next Coal Supper game."
Thank Goodness You’re Here!,2366980,176957623,Got to love this quirky game especially the british comedy made it interesting for me as i am a huge fan of that. been a while since i played a game and played it trough till the end. definitely recommend if you like somethign quirky :D
Thank Goodness You’re Here!,2366980,177084101,"I love the hundred-hour epic as much as the next guy but short games are good too. This is one of them.

It's silly, fun, and just the right length, if the crescendo of absurd went on much longer it would start to feel stale and forced, but as it is, it ends while I was still having fun.

I do feel I'm missing a lot of cultural context, so my main takeaway is that the Norf is a very silly place.

Recommended!"
Thank Goodness You’re Here!,2366980,177938174,short game (roughly 2.5 hours) with platforming elements and puzzle solving. quirky british comedy and excellent audio design. slap everything.
Thank Goodness You’re Here!,2366980,178164638,"What a gem. It's short, but worth the full price. It's quirky, strange, and hilarious. It's unlike anything I've played, it's one of the most original games I've had the pleasure of trying. I wish I could play it for the first time again.

As long as you're okay with weirdness, do give it a try. It's absolutely perfect in what it does, and it's bound to make you laugh."
Thank Goodness You’re Here!,2366980,177125006,"Thank goodness you're here! There's a tiny yellow lad running about slapping every little thing he comes across! Reyt bit of mischief, that. What is he like? Though I reckon you'll need to be that way, if you're to see all the sights.

Thank Goodness You’re Here!,2366980,178798181,"Fun game, great jokes. Had to go around and smack everything to find out what funny joke I could find. Found it great being able to see/meet people over and over."
Thank Goodness You’re Here!,2366980,178739340,"This game has completely surprised me and I fully enjoyed every minute of it. At any point where I thought I knew where the story was going, I was swiftly reminded that NO I don't know where this is going. The humor of this was a massive selling point for me and something that kept me laughing the entire time I played, especially all of the off-handed jokes and passive adult humor.

The art style and vibrant color of this fits with the humor so well, it worked so perfect to tell the story they wanted. Each character was so interesting to look at, even if they were minor background characters. Every character had a story that I could follow as I played each section, which made going back to each area not feel repetitive. The direction of the story was pretty linear, though all of the quests could be seen as a lot. You were in the area you needed to be and you weren't able to move on if you missed something important. That was something I really appreciated, as going back to the previous area was something that you aren't able to do very quickly."
Thank Goodness You’re Here!,2366980,178630133,"This game was relaxing and entertaining. I liked it even more than the Untitled Goose Game. Silly, not too complicated, and enjoyable.

I think if you have a good sense of humor this is a perfect game for you.

I played this on the steam Deck and didn't have any issues."
Thank Goodness You’re Here!,2366980,178624893,"This is such a great little game. A throwback to the cheeky British comedy of the 70's and 80's. It's under 3 hours, but you'll have a grin on your face the whole time."
Thank Goodness You’re Here!,2366980,178553570,"A lot of fun! The sense of humour in this game is right up my alley, the art style is great and it was very enjoyable to play. 
It's doesn't have a lot of replay in it once you have gotten all the achievements, but if this got some dlc I would certainly play that too. 
"
Thank Goodness You’re Here!,2366980,178492814,"I downloaded the game after seeing clips of the game on various social media. The initial video already announced a game with bells and whistles.
Full of sexual jokes, I recommend it to an audience of adults (or people who are close to adulthood). I would gladly play it again and I hope that the production company releases a saga about it."
Thank Goodness You’re Here!,2366980,178453789,Silly and fun. Its such a fun and silly game that me and my mole wife enjoy
Thank Goodness You’re Here!,2366980,178437296,"The most accurate Northern English simulator of all time. There are so many moments that hit way too close to home, but as someone from Yorkshire, it should do. it's quite possible some of the funniest, stupidest and dumbest humour that I loved to pieces, I only wished that it was longer, but for what it is, It's a great time"
Thank Goodness You’re Here!,2366980,178434509,"This was such a breath of fresh air for me. I loved playing this. The sense of humour was right up my street, it made me properly laugh several times. I loved exploring and solving the puzzles. Great on Steam Deck too. Recommended."
Thank Goodness You’re Here!,2366980,178428791,"unique concept marvelously executed.
funny to listen to, pretty to look at, and, most importantly, LOADS of fun to play.

Factorio,427520,177193493,I'm genuinely scared to play this game because while i am bad i have had actual relationships end over this game. I'm sorry Catherine but the factory must grow
Factorio,427520,177424982,I have been counting down the days to the new Space Age DLC just so I can spend another 400 hours building up a new base from scratch on the starting planet before even considering going to the newly added planets. 10/10 game - my friends are tired of me recommending it to them so i will now recommend it to you.
Factorio,427520,177467509,"The game is top tier no critiques, just wanted to show some appreciation for how amazing the developer is.
This was an Early Access game, they spent the time to fully flesh out the base game which is now amazing and pushed it to full release. Fostered an amazing modding community with built in modding support so people could extend the game.
Now 4 years later brought on the amazing modder to build a fully fleshed out expansion which actually significantly expands the game.
No fake Factorio 2 to milk money, no dlc farming every year for money. 
Even with the DLC now available you can revert to any old version of the game and still play the mods if you can't afford the update or just want to play an older version.

The crazy devs honestly built a whole game from early access with an expansion without trying to rip anyone off, just focused on making a great game.

Stand up and take a bow.
"
Factorio,427520,177459804,"After clocking in over 600 hours in Factorio, I can confidently say that this isn't just a game—it's a technical rite of passage. First you start the seemingly simple exploration of this game. You begin as a lone miner and soon developers give you the keys to see far beyond from the raw, unoptimized mess of spaghetti belts to the finely-tuned, logic-driven masterpiece of an motherboard architect. Maybe you invite a buddy to your world to see into one's logical mind.
You can witness your friend evolve from a novice installer to a master architect too, which is fascinating.

To sum the effects of enjoyment: Factorio will change the way you think. The initial friction burns your brain, my friend called Factorio ""a parasite inside your day-to-day mind"".
It indeed nudges you to aim from chaos into streamlined perfection.  It transforms the way you look at systems, whether in the game or in life. and alter how you approach problems, not just in the game, but in real life too. After optimizing blueprint layouts and production ratios, you might find yourself analyzing your workflow in daily tasks offline.
I though that the final break through is simply launch the rocket and get the Win-screen. Then finally manage to chase other digital masterpieces. But no. Rocket launches? They’re the new baseline, new mindset to adopt.

10/10. Immensely entertaining, infinite, elegant ultimate engineering playground and a journey that deconstructs your logical thinking. I can already see onward optimizing the flow of both resources and ideas."

This game is all about automating every possible process and fixing mistakes that you've made and believe me, even when you think you didn't make a mistake, you probably did.

Honestly, most of the time I'm not sure what I'm doing. Sometimes I feel good about something I did and then I realize that what I did was stupid and needs to be fixed. [i]Factorio[/i] can be challenging and automating everything feels very satisfying. 
The progression feels good as well & you always have something to do and if you're someone that likes to min-max everything you're going to have a field day with this game. Fair warning though: It's [i]a bit[/i] [b]addicting[/b].

[i]The Factory must grow - it doesn't matter how. Destroy nature. Eradicate the alien species that stands in your way. Everything must work. The Numbers need to go up. Everything must be automated. The Factory must grow.[/i]

"
Factorio,427520,177646731,"Factorio makes me feel like an idiot and smart at the same time. Bless the devs for their brains being able to structure the game with such complexity. This game also has a very hypnotizing quality and you lose your sense of time. This game is not easy so the sense of accomplishment is very high.
I was playing this game when my mom was going through a tough cancer journey and COVID was just starting. So, this game, and also the soundtrack, have higher significance as they were there during tough times. 
Have not yet tried the Space Age expansion but excited to see what it is like."
Factorio,427520,178236660,"I'm generally pretty picky about graphics, but despite the less-than-stellar graphics present in Factorio, it's such an incredibly rich sim content-wise that it supercedes all else. It balances combat, construction, logistics, and progression in such stellar fashion that it is rarely frustrating and always engaging.

It's also a great game if you have kids or need to step away at a moment's notice as ESC pauses and you can often just let your factory run for a bit without pausing anyway.

Despite all of the above, it's also 100+ hours of enjoyment. The QOL is incredible and puts most other games to shame.

That said... good luck getting used to the Q button.  LOL."
Factorio,427520,177117002,"Great gaming experience, but the ever increasing prices for the base game and expansion are not something I can support."
Factorio,427520,177083790,"Painfully out of touch egotistical developers raise the price of the game ""for inflation""... yeah right! These guys have a huge ego if they think they are the only video game on the planet that deserves to never go on sale and increase in price as time goes on. Get real!"
Factorio,427520,177494943,"Imagine seeing DLC priced at the same inflated niche tax price as the base game, then going to the forums to find out whats going on, only to see a pinned thread explaining the people responsible refuse the entire concept of a discount because its unfair or something, though ironically I bet I could buy a resold key from some random Russian for half the price, but I guess its one of those modern values that only applies to things they want it applied to and not others.

To top it off, anyone questioning this is met with an absolute flood of sickening comments suggesting they are simply too poor, and are unwelcome as either community members or customers.

The fact is, if every DLC cost literally the same as its base game, the only people with money left would be the ones that have fanatical, unhealthy addictions to singular games, who spend next to nothing on the hobby to begin with, but if those are the target audience here, I'm sorry I didn't realise before hand, should have made that desire clearer before taking my money.

It's not enough for me to simply not buy the DLC. This is so souring I'm not interested in this base game itself anymore, or the developers, the community, nothing. I already uninstalled the game and I'd rather go and give that money to literally any of the other games I enjoy."
Factorio,427520,177415844,"Fantastic game and very addicting, If you like solving problems and progression this game has it. The mods are plentiful and the company is still producing content for the game. Super satisfying to get to late game and watch robots do all the work for you."
Factorio,427520,177457442,Amazing game. Still the best factory game even among the hundreds of other games inspired by it. It has a delightful learning curve which teaches you this incredibly deep game step by step in a way that never leaves you overwhelmed. You could spend thousands of hours playing this and still have new strategies to explore and things to improve. There is always a new challenge to overcome.
Factorio,427520,177711026,"not sure how i've never given factorio the thumbs up before. genuinely the singular master class in immaculate game design. hard to run out of positive things to say about the game, and all of the free 2.0 updates breathe new life the game hardly needed. this will remain one of the games of the century, no matter what happens in the next 76 years."
Factorio,427520,178544739,"This game is magic. I boot it up at 1 pm, play for 2 hours, and somehow, mysteriously, the time is now 2 am.
It makes me play 120 hours in 14 days.
It makes me forget to eat dinner in time before I am starving.
This game is crack, and the Space Age DLC just made it worse because, with the big 2.0 update for the regular game alongside it, I can now see the funny Science Per Minute number, and brain like funny number go big.

Cracktorio: Space Crack

10/10

I am writing this while waiting for my bots to give me more buildings to grow the factory.
The factory must grow.
You will commit a ton of negotiating against the local environmentalists in order to grow the factory."
Factorio,427520,177501552,"This is the game that made the automation genre something you'll see often on the front page of the store. I want to say it ""spawned"" the factory automation genre of games but that may be overstating somewhat—but it is nonetheless why games like Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program, and Desynced exist and are bought by lots of people. It should say something that Factorio was huge years before its ""release"" in 2020."
Factorio,427520,178732046,"The game never goes on sale, but it is worth every penny.

It has got infinite replay value, allowing you to start each map through manual labor, to spawling automated factories that span entire continents.

The developers are also obsessive about quality, working tirelessly to release patches about every week, generating a nigh bug-free experience.

10/10"
Factorio,427520,177545341,"Under normal circumstances I would recommend this game however at this point I am put off by its latest price point, when I originally purchase this game it was a standard price of £15 no discounts or anything and I happily bought it then, now with the launch of the DLC I find it is £30 and another £30 for the DLC making it a £60 game, which to be quite frank is far too much.

I will say that the quality is very good and well made, it will keep you entertained for many months, I just can't agree with the price point, had the DLC and game been £15-£20 I would of bought it immediately, I just can't justify buying this at this time."
Factorio,427520,178051299,"Honestly thought this game was not going to be for me because I am terrible at resource management games/organization. Took a chance and played the demo and now I am addicted to cracktorio, the factory MUST GROW, IT WILL GROW. But seriously, a gem of a game that makes time slip away without realizing how much time has passed. I highly recommend this to anyone that doesn't think that this is their cup of tea to try the demo and give it a chance. One of those rare games that must be experienced if your a gamer. Seriously, just stop reading reviews and download the demo, time is slipping by while you can be expanding your factory and bringing industrialism while smiting down the natives of the land, just like a real engineer would."
Factorio,427520,177787045,best game you can spend so much time playing and never get to bored and the game just keeps expanding and growing so much that you have to start over again just to get the full experience to play the game in all its joy
Red Dead Redemption,2668510,177977179,"Amazing game, but charging 50€/$ for a 14 year old game is ridiculous. If it was an actual remake with RDR2 graphics, new features then fine but this is just greedy. Definitely worth putting it to your wishlist and wait for atleast 50% discount."
Red Dead Redemption,2668510,177980013,"An excellent PC port for a classic 14-year-old game. But pricing it at $50 for a 14-year-old game is scummy. If you've never played it before, you'll get your money's worth with its brilliant open world, characters, and story, but wait for a sale if you've already experienced this game on previous platforms."
Red Dead Redemption,2668510,178020755,"Fantastic game, no question but slapping a 50€/$ price tag on a game that’s practically collecting dust for 14 years? Bold move. If they’d thrown in RDR2 level visuals, some fresh mechanics, or, you know, actual upgrades, maybe it’d feel worth it. As of right now, it’s wishlist material with a strict 50% off or bust policy! C’mon, we’re not made of nostalgia dollars!"
Red Dead Redemption,2668510,177976639,"Here are some fun facts about this game:
Fact 1: This game is older than most fortnite players.
Fact 2: Imagine a 16-year-old kid in 2010 with only a computer, how badly he wanted to play this game. But now , he's 30"
Red Dead Redemption,2668510,177978573,"Congratulations, you have survived long enough to see Red Dead Redemption on PC.

Red Dead Redemption,2668510,178134395,It's a solid port with it's only controversy being that's it's $50 for a 14 year old game with some changes for modern pc's. If you played it before but ain't dying to play it again like me just wait for a sale.
Red Dead Redemption,2668510,178201811,Its a great game but  not for $50..I recommend waiting on a sale..i refunded bcuz not much is changed just a lil graphic improvement so therefore i dont think its worth $50..Rockstar getting carried away with their pricing
Red Dead Redemption,2668510,178290865,"Games like this are why I wish Steam had a neutral recommendation option. On one hand, this is Red Dead Redemption. One of the greatest open-world games ever, finally on PC after 14 years.

On the other hand, there are virtually no changes that have been made to this game that Rockstar are willing to charge full price for, AND they've removed multiplayer. The graphics look basically the same, there isn't any additional content as far as I am aware. Unless you've never played this game before, it's best just to wait until it's on special."
Red Dead Redemption,2668510,178039359,"The game runs pretty well and I have not experienced any bugs so far. As others mentioned, the $50 price is the biggest and maybe only shortcoming of this port."
Red Dead Redemption,2668510,178027555,"Pros:
+ runs great, locked at 144 fps at 3440x1440 at ultra settings (Ryzen 7 7800X3D + Radeon 7900XT + 32 GB of 6000 Mhz RAM)
+ updated graphics look decent and HDR is implemented very well
+ full ultrawide support (but cutscenes are still cropped)
+ controls feel responsive
+ base game is still a masterpiece

Cons:
- includes the Rockstar Launcher
- character models are still fairly low poly 
- some minor glitches 
- 50€ for a 14 year old game are a bit excessive

Get it on sale, you won't be disappointed."
Red Dead Redemption,2668510,178354855,"disgustingly overpriced

but besides that this is a great port of a masterpiece, this is 100% worth picking but wait for a sale"
Red Dead Redemption,2668510,178097602,"I am giving this game a negative review not because of the game itself but because of Rockstar's insane business policies that make me unable to play the game. I have purchased this game on my one and only steam account and when I attempt to play the game I am asked to sign in to a Rockstar Social Club account using an email that I do not recognize. I realize that whatever account I used to have years ago must have gotten hacked. I think ""no problem"" and create a new Social Club account, but NO. You cannot create a new account. You MUST log in with the account linked to your steam account or you cannot play the game you purchased. There is no appeal process, there is no customer support that you can contact over this as Rockstar's customer support is fully automated now. There is no way to unlink accounts without first signing in to Rockstar's website. There is no solution except to refund the game and create a new steam account. Miserable, dreadful company, I will never be buying another one of their products."
Red Dead Redemption,2668510,178132641,"This negative review isn't representative of the game itself, which has been and always will be outstanding, it is merely to protest the outrageous practice of having the consumer pay for a game and mandate they sign up to make a ""Rockstar Account"" to play a single player experience. Egregious."
Red Dead Redemption,2668510,178034815,"Steam Deck Review:
Gotta love the gameplay of being kicked out of the game and getting a black screen because you're not connected to the internet. If you're planning to buy this with the intention of playing it offline and on the go then I would heavily disregard this game. This game kicks you out of a 50$ game YOU the consumer bought because you don't have internet for a SINGLEPLAYER game. I was super excited to play this last night and downloaded it when I had wifi, only to be met with a screen saying I need to be signed into rockstar games to play it. Loved the game back then but this one right here is one of the reason why we need physical copies still, pay for a game and you can't even play it without signing MULTIPLE terms of agreements.

Edited review: Review up top was a first hands impression of using the rockstar launcher. I will say after signing into an account and being online for a day you can use it offline for the foreseeable future. However being new to the having to sign in into an online launcher for an offline game that I could've done no problem back in 2010 when the game released is still stupid.
Gameplay: I find that the game runs really great on the steam deck compared to most steam games I find ""playable"" on there. If I hadn't run into any issue initially I'd say this would be a perfect fit for the steam deck seeing as I get no frame drops while playing the game for long periods of hours.

Feel free to add more to my review below whether you like it or not. This was just my first hands experience dealing with issues like this and I still feel like it shouldn't be this way."
Red Dead Redemption,2668510,178203344,"About time, RDR is finally on PC. Better late than never. And im pleased to say the port is actually properly done, no bugs or issues to report. Not like the GTA trilogy fiasco.

But at the current price it is just way too expensive.  Come on Rockstar, don't be bigger theives that the O'Driscoll gang!!!"
Red Dead Redemption,2668510,177992813,"I don't know the reason for such high price over a 14 year old port, not even a remaster, I assume it was due to the new dev team who helped with the port, or perhaps how difficult it was to port it over? (since the code had issues) Or is it the greed? Whatever it is, it's way too much for such an old game no matter how good it might be. I got it by selling some old steam inventory useless pixels I collected over the years. Anyway all that matters is that I am enjoying the game first time playing, perhaps far more than some newer games and that says a lot. At least its DLC is also on it and has some ""fixes"" to it. Runs perfectly well on my PC, no fps or graphical issues whatsoever so far but make sure you meet the requirements..

Aside the old graphics and usual tedious open world stuff, it feels like a game that just released this year, the experience so far, it has aged well and I am immersed. Of course get used a bit to the herd stuff in the beginning and some other stuff. It has a great introduction to the world, takes you slowly through each area, great dialogue, the npcs/world feels alive and all, as expected from a Rockstar title.

 ...can't wait for those mods to upgrade the graphics a bit I guess, add new stuff to it.

Edit: The Mexico part of the story is when it starts to get better, the map is a lot better too there."
Red Dead Redemption,2668510,178099959,"Amazing game, fantastic port. There's no way this should be 50 dollars though, the visual improvements don't justify the price point. The only reason i've bought it is because it's been 14 years since I've played it. For that, it's worth it to me. "
Red Dead Redemption,2668510,177982007,"This review is not about the quality of the game but rather the price for what you get. What you receive for $50 USD is a port of a game that released 14 years ago and it's DLC expansion. While it is nice to have this game freed from console limitations, it is quite literally just a port of the PS3/X360 version with FSR and DLSS added in, which shouldn't be necessary since it's so old and adding those into a game is so easy that modders do it on release day for some games. You still get muddy textures, weird audio, NPCs getting stuck on terrain during story missions, etc.

On the performance end, everything seems fine. I'm using a 3060 so I'd expect it to run well, which it did. The Steam Deck seemed to struggle with some higher settings, even with FSR on Ultra Performance.

This is a great game and deserves a proper remaster and maybe the modding community will really transform this game into the remaster it deserves. Please wait to pick this up until it's on sale for $30 which is a way more reasonable price. If you bought this like I did, I implore you (heh) to refund and wait until the price drops."
Red Dead Redemption,2668510,177993807,greedy swine rockstar wants $50 for this. forced rockstar login just to enable cloudsave and there's no multiplayer of course (unsurprising since rdr2 multiplayer has long since been abandoned anyhow.) undead nightmare is included at least. wait for sale.
Red Dead Redemption,2668510,178308564,"Great game. Glad they brought it to pc and it runs good so far, but not worth 50 bucks. Rockstar are a bunch of penny pinchers. Surprised they didn’t add micro transactions to this too."
New World: Aeternum,1063730,177053723,"I got 582 hours of some of the most fun i have had in an MMO. Playing solo or with some pals its just fun man.

I get the negative comments about endgame, but 582hrs for £50, is good in my books.

Play it, enjoy it, have fun and when you finish everything, its okay to go and play something else, trust me, its ok. There is a lot to do here as a new player now, you will get the hours out of it, and you will enjoy it."
New World: Aeternum,1063730,177132786,"This game still has some things to improve but in general I had and still have some fun with it. The combat is one of the most fun of all the MMORPG I have ever played. Sometimes I just wanna chill and gather/farm resources while listening some music and this game allows me to do it to relax and chill.

Most people complain about the Endgame, and indeed it deserves more love. But, I started playing it on release,it took me months to get to max level, and without any good build. I didn't rush to endgame, I enjoyed the game and honestly there are some content that I haven't even tried yet, like mutations and some Dungeons,several quests, and this alone gave me at least 500 hours of fun. This was my choice of how I'd play the game, my suggestion is try to find yours."
New World: Aeternum,1063730,177094847,"Despite the community constantly selling this game short, it's a really impressive and fun MMORPG experience. I've played since the original beta and while there was certainly some growing pains, the devs have put a lot of love into this game and the new Aeternum Revamp is just incredible. 

Really looking forward to what is to come!"
New World: Aeternum,1063730,177124647,"I played this game since day 1, on and off, but with the console launch they chose to update the UI for consoles and it's awful for PC players. It's locked to 16:9 aspect ratio, everything is oversized and pushed to the middle of the screen with no option to adjust it in any way. Did they really forgot that we PC players were here first, did they just chose to ignore us?"
New World: Aeternum,1063730,177079477,"You should play New world and here is why:

Weapons and abilities - rarely do you find an mmo with classless combat done right, there truely is no right or wrong build here. Sure, will you deal less damage if you choose the “wrong” weapons and ability combinations? Yes, do you like how playing with them feels? Then do it because the game gives you that freedom.

Story - traditionally most players skip through dialogue in games like this to progress faster, nothing wrong with that and I am very much one of those people, but now that every main quest is voice acted and sets the scene for a world that is constantly changing and evolving as you progress on the adventure. Your journey and why you are fighting the monsters and creatures ties in very well without being too cheesy or forced.

Player vs environment - the combat feels punchy, you feel very powerful throught most of the game while still maintaining a sense of struggle to get to the top. Progression feels meaningful and planning ahead of your next fight will benefit you greatly. I have high hopes for future pvm encounters because the developers have left so much room to expand on current and future mechanics alike.

Player vs player - whether you want short, straight forward fighting, strategic push and pull objective based fights, or chaotic open world free for all duels and open world pvp, it’s there. Nothing to lose and everything to gain, the game encourages you to home your skills which will benefit your teammates and give a sense of gradification when you outplay your opponents.

Crafting and economy - certain games draw out crafting in a way that is insanely vital for late game, and not easy enough to grasp at an early level but in my opinion new world provides all of the information needed to make your next tool, or craft your next weapon, hell even making a satchel to store all of your goodies you collect. The economy is ever changing and theres is always a new and interesting way to make gold and push towards your next house, weapon, armor, or hell even a new drumset! 

TLDR - New world has a solid foundation and will keep evolving for the better which will always keep me coming back until they delete the game or make new world 2, give it a try and I’ll see you in the Aeternum!"
New World: Aeternum,1063730,177104590,"Players that purchased the New World base game, but have not gotten the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion will need to purchase the RotAE expansion to get access to all of the content in New World: Aeturnum. Real Poor choice im not paying for half made DLC with barely any content to play a big update. Could have been better"
New World: Aeternum,1063730,177071591,"My message for to steam regarding this game:

After two years of PC gamers playing this game, Amazon Games studio essentially announced that, in order to play the new content of this game that is being released 10-15-24. You essentially have to start over from zero. We (PC Players) essentially, beta tested this game for two years roughly, so that console players will have the opportunity to play. However, in order to for any  new or additional content to be available for PC players, we have to start new accounts essentially, in order to be able to play the game and its future updates. This is highly unethical and shady business that AGS is forcing upon its PC player base. I am fully against supporting any behavior of this type am disgusted by the developer for this type of maneuver, especially after spending hundreds of dollars on in-game currencies and cosmetics to only be told, ""thanks for your cash, but F-You, you've got to start all the way over from scratch again."""
New World: Aeternum,1063730,178355829,bought it when it first came out. came back to everyone riding around on horses and here i am running across the map unless i pay an extra $30.... couldn't even give the players that already paid too much for this game an ugly basic horse at least? That's a base level feature in even the worst MMOs. You're extortion artists and Amazon won't be seeing any more money from me when it comes to gaming as a result. Congrats
New World: Aeternum,1063730,177452648,"I played about 1500 hours of this game when it came out.  I had a good time, but poor decisions by the devs, and constant dwindling player base caused me to eventually move on.  

Recently they have released the game again as a kind of ""I promise it's better than the shambles it was"", so I thought I'd pick it up and give it a go to see if the changes are good.  

They are not good.   Any game of this genre, grinding into the endgame is 99% of the game.  They have now put the end game behind a paywall equal to about what I paid for the game on release.   Without the paid content, you are unable to get a mount, hit max level, or do any of the end game activities.  What a joke.  I am now unable to play the game properly, without essentially buying it again.  Amazon studios is essentially a scam. 

They're clearly trying to squeeze the last bit of sap from a dying tree.  And die it will.  Bit of a shame really."
New World: Aeternum,1063730,177110748,"Game plays well, environments are great, weapon variety is great, music is great, tradeskills are fun early on. Only thing is the longevity so we'll see if Amazon is fully committed to frequent updates now."
New World: Aeternum,1063730,177131431,The launch of New World Aeternum was advertised as a complete relaunch of the ip to finally bring it back to the glory days it once had. Launching the game will reveal they only slightly adjusted the UI and the only differing content is the tutorial. They focused on completely rebranding the game to make is able to be sold on consoles and not actually fixing the core problems the game has had for two years.
New World: Aeternum,1063730,177666762,"Apart from the game not starting 50% of the time i try to open it, and the insane server lag as well as the overpriced micro transactions (£20 for a battlepass) oh and the awful balancing in the game after level 65 ah and I almost forgot how much of a slog the game becomes after level 55 til 65 and the lack of content updates for endgame since launch along with the fact they charge AAA prices for a game which barely functions (animations not working, constant stutters,crashes bugs all coming from the 5th richest company in the world btw) I suppose its pretty fun 

it would be worth it for £30 not £50

"
New World: Aeternum,1063730,177116862,"Wild that after being an early access user and waiting for the game to improve, us existing owners still don't even get a discount on the DLC, that is overpriced. I enjoy the game, there isn't anything like it out there, but Amazon has been kicking around users for too long now and not knowing which direction to take the game. I (along with many others) have been waiting for that to come back.

I'm leaving a negative review, only for these reasons. As a game for a new player, this is a good purchase with no sub and a nice cash shop, but just be forewarned, they have no idea direction wise what they should be doing yet, and it's shown over the past couple years."
New World: Aeternum,1063730,177814069,"Game is currently UNPLAYABLE. 100+ crashes due to 'Lag Detection"" anti-cheat in first week of new release.

New World: Aeternum,1063730,177511200,Bought the game for 40 dollars when it released. Wanted to come back and give the game a try because of the update. I see that there is now a standard edition for 60 and a expansion pass for 30. New players can just buy the standard edition and have full access to the new update without even buying the expansion pass. The issue is players are returning and might accidentally buy the standard edition not knowing that if they just buy the expansion pass for 30 dollars they have access to the full update because they already had the base game. If you don't see the issue with this idk what to tell u
New World: Aeternum,1063730,177199058,"They removed ultrawide support in the aeternum update, and now say the game doesn't support it, I've got so many hours in this game using ultrawide and now the UI is 16:9"
New World: Aeternum,1063730,177152579,"New update definitely worth getting back into the game. Can't say much for end game content but if you're a casual player looking for an MMO to sink time into you'll get a good experience, or just rush and complain there's no content."
New World: Aeternum,1063730,177438370,"I did not enjoy this game when it first came out. They've made a lot of improvements and it's a genuinely fun time.

New World: Aeternum,1063730,177478318,"well... first the gameplay is interesting and good
but mounts should either be free for everyone or the dlc should cost max 20
old players that dont already have the dlc basicly need to pay more then new players for what now is the base game since the dlc is integrated in the new base game..
Also the dialogue system is buggy and has missing voice lines and many cringe moments.. and the graphics look weird
Game somehow feels like an indie game now"
New World: Aeternum,1063730,177058967,"Played on Launch for long time, was very fun, but definitely had its bugs and exploits. Played even more with the Angry Earth expansion, that was an even better time. The game was more polished and less prone to problems. With this relaunch I am confident that the game will be at its best so far, and can recommend it."
NBA 2K25,2878980,177432763,"Game spent an hour just compiling shaders, then they try shoving microtransactions down my face, then they pause the game to show me 2KTV which i don't care about. Only got 10 minutes of actual gameplay before deciding to refund.

NBA 2K25,2878980,178073983,"I got tricked into thinking this 2K might actually be good/different, but it isn't

Bad performance, same stupid animation based issues, NBA2K hasn't been good since it stopped being physics based and they changed it to animation based, constant players traveling and teleporting into dunking animations makes it all look so fake and feel boring, there's no intensity to taking a shot because I know for a fact if it'll hit or not

The game looks alright I guess but the CPU usage this game feels it needs to take is horrendous, and causes lots of ghosting on players and performance drops

Overall, don't buy this until it goes on a DEEP sale, the only good thing here is the ""next gen"" mode but all that does is add some more lights with the side effect of tanking performance

No money spent, no external apps used, no bots or MT buying. Just grinding and sweating the game every event dropped despite the events being so dry but cannot complain since I dont spend money in a game I have already bought,

NBA 2K25,2878980,178054173,"I've been playing NBA 2K since 2K16, and while the early games—especially Park mode—didn't have many features, the gameplay was always solid. I played through to 2K20, and each game was fun and enjoyable. However, after trying 2K25 this year, I've noticed some major issues. I live in Hong Kong, and the online mode has over 1 second of delay, making it unplayable. Also, the cost of VC has skyrocketed—it now takes around 400,000 VC to fully upgrade a player, compared to 200,000–250,000 in previous games. On top of that, cosmetics are way more expensive—like 10,000 VC for a single piece of clothing.

Another big issue is how long it takes to upgrade badges. As a casual player, it takes me about a month just to max out the badges for one player, which is frustrating. It feels like 2K is getting more grindy and expensive with every release.

I am not gonna play 2k in my life ever"
NBA 2K25,2878980,177932575,"they finally did it, they finally brought the next gen version to PC--still dont get without a sale

better than the last few years simply because of the updated graphics, WNBA modes, and dynamic animations. otherwise, its the same. 2k is trying to grub more money from you than ever, multiplayer is plagued with players who spend money to get high overalls and no balancing. does feel a little more immersive though. 

worth noting that this is the most ""fun"" mycareer hub. like other games in the series, you can buy skateboards, bikes, etc, to get around, but it gives you a free go-kart if you do two short races at the go-kart track, and the rest of the city is designed to be fun to drive around with the kart physics, lots of roundabouts, straights, and tight corners."

Not only does the score jump around like a frog on coals when you go to the bench but when you are playing it feels broken as well. A C+ nba player will drop 50 on your head because they hit highly contested 3's like a layup but you can have an 85 driving layup and miss a wide open fast break layup. You can have 90 3pt shot but unless you green that shot it has 0 chance of going in. None of this also mentions that if you want to be able to do ANYTHING as a player in the NBA you will need to buy VC to give your player any viable stats, even then spending and extra £20 on top of the game will only make you around 73 overall."

NBA 2K25,2878980,178174997,"This is the best NBA 2K of all time in my opinion. They finally changed the game and made it intuitive and fun at the same time. The biggest change is the dribbling system. The left stick dribbling and right stick dribbling has been expanded. The left stick dribbling changes based on how soft or hard you press it giving you different options from launches and crossovers. Left stick dribbling gives you the opportunity to go from walking dribbling probing a defense and getting them to bite on moves. The trick to being successful is trying to make the player do smooth animations. If a player is missing a shot don't look at a shot meter look at how you can make the animation smoother to make the shot successful. Everything is about smoothness and making things look like they should. Rhythm  shooting is heaven sent. It makes so much sense to use than simply pressing a button or using the stick shooting from past years. It's not just for jump-shooting. Use it for your step backs, pulls ups, and post jump shots. Get in practice mode and learn the game. This will unlock everything for you."

Sadly, I have to say I don't remember a version of NBA 2K that left game breaking (offline) bugs in for so long. If you play offline, you want your game to feel realistic, but sadly :
- you first have to jump through a hundred hoops to change settings before every single game, 
- rotations are still messed up (CPU putting G-league guys on the bench instead of better players), 
- defensive matchups are still busted after each timeout which makes it hell to sort out 10x a game since you can't disable CPU timeouts. 
It's just a mess when you actually play the games which should be the essence of the game, right ? 

This isn't even starting to get into the MyNBA Eras problems such as player progression (I'd actually found settings to work around those), draft class attributes randomly changing. 

I've given them a couple of months but I just can't recommend getting this game at the moment, even at half price if they discount it."

TCG Card Shop Simulator,3070070,177386168,"It's an alright game at the moment. Very slow and the gameplay loop is very basic: Buy something -> Sell it for the money -> Wait until you level up -> Buy better stuff for more money. 
You can open the card packs as well to try pull something good to sell or to keep and increase your card collection. The AI workers you can hire can make the game turn into an idler since when you get 2 you can just sit back and let them do most of the work all you need to do is end the day and keep stocked up on boxes of whatever you're selling.

The roadmap for the game also looks promising with more content which should break up the repetitive gameplay. Also the mods, amazing already with overhauls for pokemon, yu gi oh, digimon etc.

Overall it's an enjoyable game, a slow but enjoyable game."

TCG Card Shop Simulator,3070070,178816158,"Completely ignoring how good this title is as a video game, I want to instead highlight the fact that it's the full addiction loop of TCGs for less than the price of McDonald's. Ever since buying this game I haven't bought a lootbox, spun for a character, or done anything even remotely resembling wasting / spending money. I did, however, spend almost 50 hours in 3 days opening boxes of cards, and you better believe I got a few nice foils in my display case.

All of that aside, this is what we would have without the MTX / P2W market that's overtaken gaming. That dopamine buzzer used to be quite a bit cheaper."

TCG Card Shop Simulator,3070070,177200114,"I was very excited to try out the new TCG store near me. Upon entering I was instantly sprayed in the face with some sort of combination of bleach and perfume by an automated system that detected me entering. Despite this spray the smell of body odor from the group playing at the 8 tables shoved into the corner near the cash register is overwhelming. I wander around, noticing that almost all prices are marked up. I remark ""this is fair"" to no one in particular, it doesn't matter because no one listening would even be sure if I'm being sarcastic or sincere. After spending 90 minutes browsing, I elect to purchase a crinkled trading card on display for 2 dollars. As I approach the cash register, the man who appears to be the manager is frantically tearing into a cardboard box full of card packs. As he opens the packs he continues swearing profusely the entire time. Eventually he screams in delight and sprints to the empty spot where I chose my 2 dollar card, slapping down a mediocre holo card with a $7.50 price tag. Finally, he decides to attend to his customers in the line. I chose to pay for my $2 card with a random assortment of coins, I think it was about $3.35. The manager once again begins cursing and fails to properly make change, handing me $1.40 in return after multiple attempts. I leave the store with my purchase and can proudly declare this is the best experience I've had in any TCG store and promptly leave a review, I will surely be returning."
WEBFISHING,3146520,177609234,"As I entered my first public lobby, I was warmly greeted with an invitation to a wedding ceremony. The proceedings were held on a private island, with drinks, snacks, and most importantly bait provided! Upon my arrival I was eagerly informed that, as part of the celebration, additional marriage proceedings would be offered upon request. 

The host also informed me that a suitable marriage partner would be provided to me free of charge! Thus I quickly snatched up this fabulous opportunity, and I am now happily married to the beautiful Skito. 

Unfortunately, the ceremony had to end, and with it, my new marriage. As quickly as love was given, it was taken away! Skito, my love, I will always cherish the 20 minutes we spent together, and I will never forget you."
WEBFISHING,3146520,177552128,"Started playing because it looked like a game my best friend would have loved, fishing and connecting with random people was his whole Sea of Thieves experience.

Nonetheless much love to West for making this game, and congrats on the success their game is having !"
WEBFISHING,3146520,178308828,"The quick popularity of this game really shows how badly people have been wanting more games that you can just jump into and play. No meta to read up on, no game seasons that force you to play to get the best rewards, and no pressure to be at a certain level to keep with other player; in this game you just gotta fish. I like that, we need more games like this, not everyone has time for 300+ hour games these days and its nice to have ones where you can hop on, do a bit of fishing, and leave at your pleasure. I look forward to see how this game evolves over the coming year and with its very obvious Animal Crossing inspiration features such as bug and fossil hunting could add a lot to the game in my personal opinion.

Yeah big recommendation from me, I rarely write reviews on here so I definitely see some potential in this game."
WEBFISHING,3146520,176931760,so cute and fun and awesome......would love the option to preview how clothes/eyes/etc look on your character before you purchase!!

"
WEBFISHING,3146520,177590598,"The human race is simply better off for this having been made. It's a benefit to mankind on the same level as fire, or electricity."
WEBFISHING,3146520,177084415,"Genuinely outstanding game. Worth every penny, and I RARELY say that about games I like. I would happily pay 10 or even 20 dollars more for this in hindsight.

The game is a purposeful grind, but it is designed around the grinding being fun, engaging, and socially rewarding, unlike other grindy games that abuse your FOMO and other marketing strategies to maximise engagement. This game HAS a grind, but you will be smiling and chatting happily all the way through it and in the end the grind is worth it to look back on all the little fishies you've reeled in.

The fishing minigame, a gaming classic, is actually a rather unique one. Its a bit different from the classic ""click when the water moves"" but its also a bit less complicated than the ""keep the dot on the line"" style like Stardew Valley uses. The minigame is able to be done entirely with a single button (left mouse) which makes this a very nice game to play while eating, watching a show, etc.

I have a lot more kind words to say about this but honestly it wouldn't make sense. The game is very great and I like it a lot. I hope to god that the developer is able to keep adding content and secrets as they go, and keep the live support and community as healthy as possible, because this game has such neat little moments and interactions and the fact that they've nailed the vibe so well is impressive. Dev, whoever you are, you deserve to get RICH off of this game."
WEBFISHING,3146520,177650190,please play this game. make ur friends play this game. make ur family play this game. i love webfishing. women fear me fish want me
WEBFISHING,3146520,177620062,"[h1]Get Fish. Sell Fish. Talk Nonsense.[/h1]

A simple, low poly Animal Crossing like fishing game based around a cute little island with different fishing spots. There's not a huge amount of depth, simple goals to complete and it's 5 bucks which on the surface seems like a game without much to do.

But on the contrary [b]the vibe is immaculate[/b]. This game is multiplayer first and while their is no active collaborative mechanics the true joy in this game comes from basically treating the multiplayer as a chill chatroom where people shoot the shit while they fish together. The colourful aesthetic combined with the customisation options and the handful of various toys to let players be expressive and communicative makes it bizarrely easy to spend hours just standing in one place casting a rod and playing a very simply mini game to pick up fish because you're just enjoying hanging out with other people and the creators know this. There are upgrades and alike that support and allow for a much more passive form of game where you can cast your rod then go and get yourself a drink, or have a smoke or something and anything you catch on your line will wait until you come back to your keyboard to interact with the game.

 In an internet where everything is memes, gifs, zoomer brainrot and links to tiktoks this is a genuine island of tranquillity where every aspect of the game puts everybody in a calm and wholesome headspace and that means that the conversation and demeanour of the people you're sharing the island with is equally calm and wholesome. The visuals, the clothing, the overall feel of the game very much tends towards the early 30's millennial mindset who grew up failing at learning to skate, listening to pop punk and wearing chains on the belt loops of their jeans.

This game is just the best low impact way to degauss your brain in the evening and I genuinely can't wait to see where this game goes next because the devs have truly captured, not so much a gameplay loop or a mechanical system, but a genuine vibe and infused it into every aspect of the game and I want to see what else they can enviben and add to this little gem."
WEBFISHING,3146520,177115808,"Excellent game

Good base mechanics, simple concept, funny delivery. 

You can kiss"
WEBFISHING,3146520,177862096,"Strikethrough text ([strike] example [/strike]) means a point is no longer valid as of the most recent update and will be removed soon. Please let me know if I missed something. [b] Bold [/b] means something new from the most recent update.

Here are some things that I feel are important to know and/or that I wanted to know before I bought this game:

MOST IMPORTANT: This game currently does *not* have cloud saves. So if you're playing on PC and want to play on your steam deck, prepare to start all over again. This is by far the biggest negative i've found with this game yet. [b] Going off the 1.09 patchnotes, this will be addressed soon [/b]

Other things:

• There is no voice chat. (this can be a positive or negative depending on player)
• There can be up to 12 players in a server. [b] You can now make the max player count lower when setting up a server. [/b]
• The fishing minigame requires rapid mouse clicking. [b] There is an autoclicker that can be enabled in the settings to help with this. [/b]
• Servers are hosted by players for free. If the host disconnects, the whole server closes.
• There are 4 settings for server privacy: Public, Code-only, [b]Friends-only[/b] and Offline/Solo. Anyone in a public or code lobby can obtain or share the code to share with others. The lobby code is a 6 digit code for example ""FOU2HR"".
• [b] You can mark your server as ""18+"". This doesn't change anything gameplay wise, but it is shown on the server listing as well as making a pop-up appear for players who join your server that they need to accept. [/b]
• There is no lobby descriptions, what you can see before you join is: the host's name and the playercount, formatted as ""TheQuackinator4's Lobby [4/12]"" [b] You can change the server name as well as of 1.09, as well as being able to see if the host has set the server to 18+. [/b]
• The host can kick or ban players
• You can mute and hide players
• Players can punch eachother, including into the water. This can be disabled for you in the settings.
• The game chat seems to have a similar culture to MMOs, for better or worse. The public lobbies are very much not for younger and/or more sensitive players.
• Adding on to the previous point, as the ""mature content description"" on the steam page mentions, the game itself contains some mild swearing and jokes that wouldn't be appropriate for younger players.
• While the game doesn't seem to save between devices, if you leave or are removed from a server, any progress you made on that server does save on that device, so you don't need to worry about restarting every time
• You can draw and erase stuff in certain areas of the game, including being able to draw over and erase other players' drawings.
• If you don't use a code, the public servers you join/host seem to be in your region, as practically all players I've encountered in public servers turned out to be in Denmark, which I am too. So your experience with other players may dramatically depend on where you're located. I don't know how locally it matches players with you, whether it's in the same country or near where you live.
• [strike] This game keeps ALL chat history from your current session and will not delete any chat history until you close and reopen the game. After alot of chatting, I've found that interacting with the chat window makes the game slow to a crawl and the chat scroll bar becomes like, one pixel tall. I do not know if there's a way to delete chat history without restarting the game. [/strike]

Have any more things you want to know before you buy the game?

As a bonus tip as a thank you for reading this review, type ""[b] /wag [/b]"" in chat."
WEBFISHING,3146520,177298773,"I love this game so much. Even as a standalone game I feel like it's fun enough on its own to fish, collect junk, dress up your stupid little cat/dog thing and doodle all over the place, but being able to chat with random people while doing so is great. Really takes me back to ye olde 2000's browser chatroom games in the best way, and I hope to see more games like this pop up. Playing this while watching something or listening to a podcast and idly chatting with people is peak cozy. Just wish there was support for (even slightly) larger lobbies - and a few permanent public lobbies would be nice, as it's pretty sad to lose your fishing buddies abruptly if the host leaves."
WEBFISHING,3146520,178501796,"I want to start by saying I absolutely adore this game, but the hacking situation with an account known as 'grincher' is unacceptable, and this issue needs to be immediately addressed. Random people joining offline sessions and possibly leaking IPs is not OK."

Please turn it into full fledged animal crossing, I believe in you."
WEBFISHING,3146520,177192806,"This game achieves a very specific vibe. It feels like we got a Japan exclusive ps2 era game localized after 20 years of waiting. It's like a mix of games like Boku no Natsuyasumi and Animal Crossing, so if you are fond of either franchise, you'd be crazy not to get this game right now.

Not only it looks like a game from the very early 2000s, it is niche enough for not every popular streamer to be playing and spoiling everything to everyone via YouTube thumbnail on your YouTube homepage. 

This makes this game possible to experience like the old days where you'd figure something out and hold onto that precious information so you can tell everyone at school the next day.

It has no meta, there is no right way to play it, no stress involved whatsoever. It's just fun to find out things by exploring and experimenting.

The community (AKA randos that join your lobby if you choose to leave it open) so far has been wonderful. There are no mechanics designed so that others can ruin your fun, so they just join to roam around and fish together.

> If you have friends, it is an absolute blast.

> If you have no friends, it is ALSO an absolute blast.

PS: you can play the guitar in this game, and for a game about fishing, oddly enough it has one of the best guitar playing systems in any game I have ever seen. Me and my other guitar-playing friends have fun just trying to play chords or simple riffs.

This could honestly become my GOTY for 2024.

Get it now. You have no excuse. It's dirt cheap and it's awesome."

World of Tanks,1407200,174717072,Very fun game. Alot of DLCs to have get. Sadly World of Tanks on steam wont let you use your account you created through WG. Which I think is stupid. Not worth getting if you put hours into the game and just got steam version.

World of Tanks,1407200,172398544,Ok game. I guess.
VRChat,438100,30020020,"This game could be good, if only:

* Had a moderation team that did not target non G-rated content
* Allow for age-locked rooms, to prevent children from joining and to allow adults to be adults
* Allow for password-protected rooms to play with your friends

The number of times I've seen moderators ban people for next to nothing is likely going to prevent this game from actually becoming successful. It's unfortunate because the formula they have is actually pretty good.

UPDATE: Shortly after the posting of this review, I found myself IP-banned from the game. Cannot even access their website. The VRChat video of the banning also was ""banned"" from their community page. 

TLDR of the video: Someone else's actions resulted in a mass-banning of the entire world. This is not the way to generate a fanbase."
VRChat,438100,30024140,"developers ban normal users for having fun, while their friends get to virtually molest and curse at you while being on a whitelist that prevents you from blocking them...

steer clear of this, alternatives like altspacevr exist and are much better"
VRChat,438100,29690429,"I am having a VR setup since December and I have seen A LOT, that includes a ton of games, ""experiences"", demos. And also a bunch of social VR apps, incl. Altxxxxx, HiFi and some others. This one I have to say blows ALL these experiences out of the water - by miles!

Let me see. Today, this Friday night...I have been in a giant show which was excellently done with anime dancers. I climbed about a mile up in the sky with some people and then we dropped down. I have been in some sort of anime/game forest. I have been in a bowling alley which appeared very real, complete with 50s music and disco light :) I have been in a bar with about 20 people and a bar tender busy running around and serving drinks. I have been in an abandoned prison with scary ghosts, traps and all kinds of stuff. We have played games like CTF and we've been in an old Western town where we were the Sherrifs and shot some bad Bandit dudes :)

A lot of fun also with people showing off their insanely creative avatars. I took my headset off later on and realized that I ""experienced"" more things in one single night than a normal person could ever experience in ""real life"" in a night, uh..a week or a month even. This is just frickin' awesome beyond words.

From a technical point of view, the avatars are excellent and VRchat even allows making and importing your own from Unity. Lip sync, eye tracking and all. Some of the best avatars I have ever seen. The entire system seems polished and runs smooth.

VRChat must have hundreds of ""worlds"" including games etc. to choose from since you can browse them for an half an hour and still didn't see them all. This is crazy. Uh, that being said people can also design their own worlds and games and put them in there. Possibilites: Endless. MIND. BLOWN.

And the people are ALL extremely friendly and supportive etc.

This is VR as good as it can get with TONS of fun and infinite things to do. Seriously it's mind-blowingly good.

VRChat,438100,29973892,"so  i thought it was pretty great. Talked with some great people. Until one day the ""host"" decided to get mad at me because someone in the room was speaking arabic so he banned me???? dont really know what that is about but whatever  I only recommend this game if you are willing to bow down to whoever is the current host or be banned. Im personally not one for putting up with some guy getting off to having a sense of authority."
VRChat,438100,29744461,"This is the best application for virtual reality, hands down. I have been a member of VRchat for over two years, and the community is what makes this place so special. Each ""room"" in VRchat is a direct upload of a scene in Unity (software used to create most VR experiences). This makes it very easy for community members to upload new rooms and content. The developers of VRchat are also making the games they have (Capture the Flag, Battle Discs, etc) available in the SDK. This means over the next few months anyone can adapt these games and create new versions of them!

VRchat is a great way to gain exposure to Unity/development...but you can also just have fun and talk to others here. Other social VR apps don't even compare in that feeling of community you get when you log in. Our meetups are on Sundays, but since its public release there have been people logged in continuously. 

Come join our community, and see for yourself what makes this such a special place!"
VRChat,438100,29774313,"This was a blast. It's fun visiting all of the cool places with people. The only thing I would recommend for the devs is in the smooth locomotion mode to make it ""hand based"" orientation like Onward does it as opposed to ""head based"" turning. It makes me feel a bit off when I turn my head while moving forward and my direction changes. If dev is reading check out the difference in Arizona Sunshine's new locomotion update to see what I am talking about. I would also recommend slowing the forward locomotion down 20% or so."
VRChat,438100,29659715,"Best VR experience I have had, super easy to meet new friends who you can speak to and play games with for hours!

VRChat,438100,29713445,"The social VR games have always been my favorite, and this one is the best in my opinion.  The dev's are always on and incredibly helpful to anyone with questions.  If you've got a VR headset just grab it.  It's free and its fun."
VRChat,438100,29913339,"This is one of the most promising, brilliant, social apps out right now. It's as random as the internet and VR should be. It's got endless potential, has tons of random things to to and runs so bafflingly well I am shocked.

Someone wanted us to checkout his PT hallway world. There were like 60 people shoulder to shoulder and not a second of lag, or any framerate drops. I am baffled by it. The amount of customization they are offering and will offer in the future is crazy. It's free, everyone should be trying this out.

This is now my new go to application to show off just how cool VR can be.  Not only does the communication with other uses work almost flawlessly (if both have good headsets and a microphone) but the app itself is beautifullly constructed with multiple ""Worlds"" on can visit.  Some of these worlds offer pretty fun competive multiplayer games, like capture the flag or gold with either laser pistols or six shooters (depending on the game) other experiences are in sight and sound, like multiple movie theater spots (where you can use your Youtube to play the content you desire), presentations rooms, etc.  There is so much to explore and/or create it is awesome.  Just last night I visited a moon base, not only was it beautiful and peaceful, I was surprised to see I could leave the moonbase and walk around the moon, jump in simulated low gravity and explore!   The avatars are full body and you can choose from a number of pre-created forms as well as upload your own.  I was standing next to Wolverine (with claws and everything) yesterday.    Definite a must have for any VR user."

I reccomend getting a VR headset Pref VIVE and have a Quadcore Cpu with 8gb ram and At least a 2GB Video Card.
It Can Play with a controller Although not as Good As Vive.
You cand download the SDK to create your own avatar aswell as set up voice and facial Recognition.
It really is a great Social Platform and i recommend it too."

VRChat,438100,29640696,"This felt like the Second Life of VR, and if that is a good or bad thing depends on where they take the software. When I say that, it feels like the developers made an engine that could be used across multiple applications, and VR chat at this time is a demo for other people to take the engine and create a specific application. 

Or in another way, it feels like the second iteration of AltVR. 

Now it is free, and it is interesting to try out.. so on that it gets a YES on recommend. 
That all said, it feels unpolished in the graphics, and the activities don't really grab me. After under an hour, I hopped back into the bright and happy world of Rec Room. 

That all said.. I am going to follow this, and see how it grows. Gonna say, my other impression is that it looks like somebody wanted to transcribe EverQuest into VR."

VRChat,438100,29660093,I had a chance to log in to this chatroom last night for about 30 minutes.  VERY impressive and was really comforting someone was there to always help you in the room.  Definately one of my favorite apps for sure!!!  Looking forward to creating my own personal Avatar soon :-)
VRChat,438100,29655705,"Honestly I dont even have a VR setup, and while there are certain limitations with not owning one this is truly a fun enteraining game and environment with many updates to come. The very first night this came out on steam I was up until midnight messing around and having fun with so many people and the creators themselves who are genuine and always willing to help out anyone right away. Along with working diligently and long hours to help the entire community. I would highly recommend this game to those who are searching for some VR fun or even if you dont have a VR setup like me and just play with a keyboard and mouse or a controller definitely worth checking out at the very least and meeting the wonderfully friendly, humorous, and kind community."
PAYDAY 3,1272080,177861216,"After 1 year, I can finally write this review. 
It started as a train wreck. The game was unplayable and legit not fun at all. The grind was tedious, and the reward was non existing. 
But now the game feels really smooth. They ditched the crappy challenge mechanic, and there's rewards for going all loot possible. The new heists are really fun, as well as the weapons included. The new UI and server browsing look very promising.
In general, yes, this game is worth buying now. It wasn't at the start, but after 180 hours, I can finally say that they managed to fix this game and provide it a promising future."
PAYDAY 3,1272080,177614458,"If they kept this game in the oven for another year, and added everything that they've added so far as base game content, I think Payday 3's launch wouldn't have been so rough. The newest update is looking extremely promising to bring the ""Payday"" feel back to the game."
PAYDAY 3,1272080,177659519,"It's Payday, so I want to like it. But...Ugh I don't know.

It's not a bad game by any means. The launch was terrible. But over time certain aspects of the game have been getting better and better. Far too slowly, but it is happening. 

A friend and I would play PD2 heists over and over again and it was rare to feel bored. PD3 just doesn't seem to have that same pull. We play a heist once when it launches, then never touch it again. Our games are literally dormant until the next heist comes out so we can play that one time then drop the game again. 

something needs to improve. I couldn't say what, but something. I really want this game to have that same pull that PD2 had. I really want to come home from work, excited to launch PD3 to see what I can tackle. Maybe we just have to wait another 8 years to see what the game will become..."
PAYDAY 3,1272080,178353322,"They have listened to the fans and have updated the game to a good state. the matchmaking is tons better. there's voice but no push to talk which i think is a huge oversight. 
The game play is solid and the heists are fun. 

I 100% say yes on sale."
PAYDAY 3,1272080,177501478,"I did not experience this game on launch.  This game was released solely to prevent Starbreeze from going under. It's roots are lackluster and borderlining creatively bankrupt. It didn't help how it's lead director at the time, the infamous Mio, had a taste for harsh game mechanics that are, self-appointedly, ""worthy of a player’s anger"" (his regards on the Techie, shortly after it was released as a miserably overtuned pest (Techie was rebalanced and is really cool now)). Naturally, such a smug approach to core balance with disrespect to previous titles and traditions did not well flavor this crock of shit. 

I did not experience this game on launch. I am experiencing it now. Adaptive armor massively helps my enjoyment with it's ability to soak chip damage. The new skill lines are interesting and innovative. The DLC is goated (Deagle is objectively overpowered, even among primaries). 

When Almir said that Starbreeze is now able to start working on the core identity of PD3, polishing and rebalancing (like it should have launched as if you're asking for 40 fucking USD), I'm inclined to believe they've already started. 

Check out the update blogs and check out the roadmaps, THEN decide whether or not to come back. But if you do, I say it's a good time. I have fun. 

[h2]Game is- uh. . . visibly better with every update.[/h2] 
I recommend Gold pass on a fat discount cause the DLC is the best of the game, core heists will not take you far lol."
PAYDAY 3,1272080,177321198,"It's hard for me to recommend this but I deeply want to

This is a sequel to Payday 2, and a disappointing one.
Ignoring the content drought, there are still other many problems that add up.

Progression:
Broken. At launch it was slow and boring, now it's insanely fast and boring.
U get levels way too quick, pretty sure u can get to the max level in like 10/20 hours. After which there are only cosmetics to unlock.

Gameplay:
Major stepdown from any of the previous entries in the series no doubt.
Payday: The Heist was slow and methodical
Payday 2 was lightning fast where you got to cause pleanty of choas
Payday 3 tries to be slow like PD:TH while wanting to captivate on the PD2 community by adding things like sliding and vaulting to speed things up, but it's still slow at the core. All this results in a game that's too slow to be fast, and too fast to feel fun while playing slow.

The armour system is completely different from what the series always had. There are plenty of people who explained why it sucks so I won't do it.

Skills are all boring with most of them don't add much. Even in PD:TH which was known for always having the same gameplay with skills that just gave more armour and less recoilt, skills felt more impactful.

Heists are meant to be beat quickly in 10-15 minutes (which feels like a CoD match), a drastic contrast from the 30-50 minutes from PD2. They're all bigger than ever in the series to accompany the fast movement, which just ends up making them feel to big with how slow everything else is.

Gunplay is the only thing that seems to be an upgrade from the previous games, not that it's hard to beat since they run on a Playstation 2 racing game engine.

Enemies weirdly feel less threatening besides the Dozer. Tazers (or Zapers) never taze people. Naders die before they do anything. Shields are still pushovers but less annoying. Snipers barely ever appear to realize they have been improved. Cloakers were overhauled just for them to be spammed making them annoying. The Bulldozer is scary for the wrong reason, breaking armour possibly making the player vulnerable until the end of the heist, which can and will feel bullshit. The Techie being the only new enemy, barely ever appears, and is just there to make people move around, once again, giving the illusion of fast game in a slow one.
 
UI/HUD
UPDATE: The UI has been remade, in menus it now resembles PD2 which is good because that UI worked well but also kinda disappointing to not see much improvement.
The end of heist UI no longer completely sucks but still looks generic as fuck despite the change.
SERVER BROWSER 1 YEAR AFTER RELEASE APPLAUSE EVERYBODY APPLAUSE!
The HUD feels empty. In the Beta it had a sort curve like fish eye lenses which looked pretty cool and after release that effect was removed, character portraits were added to everyone in the lobby. They were so lazily implemented they don't even have masks on, it's just 4 images of people next to 2 bars. Speaking of bars, the armor and health bar hasn't changed since the Beta yet with the addition of these portraits the whole thing still looks like a knockoff.

Art style:
Unreal Engine project nr.209374.
We've all seen this, it has nothing special going for it besides filters, which were proven to be a bad decision for how they can end up making one thing on screen looking good and the rest bad.
Ex.: Oil room in Boys in Blue, Fear and Greed stock exchange room

Soundtrack:
Good, but not excellent like in PD2. Some tracks almost feel rushed. Boys in Blue's assault track sounds like a control track 70% of it. It ramps up somewhere in the middle for like 30 seconds and then calms down. This also applies to many other post launch tracks. The launch tracks didn't seem to have this consistency issue adding to the suspicion. The only launch track that felt unfinished was the one in touch the sky, where u can easily hear the forcely cut transition from anticipation to assault.

Content:
Throughout these 10/20 hours u'll get a decent weapon roaster, but they're not unique enough for them to feel different and it's just a ""decent"" amount meaning that quantity won't save this like in Payday 2. Overall, u'll have everything related to gameplay in no time and u'll experience all of it in less time.

Conclusion:
This could have been good, it really could have.
New engine, new possibilities, with more money invested than any other Starbreeze game, it just ended up as nothing.
It just feels like modern CoD (balancing, dev's priorities, cosmetics, movement), Payday (gameplay basis, AI, universe, partially map design) and many good ideas got mashed together into an incoherent mess. I don't think things from the past can be fixed, only new things can be made good, and with the contract for the support of the game ending somewhere Q1 in 2025, that may not happen."
PAYDAY 3,1272080,178199178,"Refrained from giving it a negative review on release. With now over a year after release, numerous updates and the famed/hyped Anniversary update its time to give a proper judgement on this game.

The core gameplayloop is fun and decent. It still needs work and refinement but nothing thats not bad.

However, in general this game feels very unfinished and underdeveloped. Crazy design decisions that are completely un fun or basically ruin the gameflow. Underdeveloped elements that are vital and core to the game experience [firearms and its customisation]. Missing basic features at launch and when added, they are straight broken.

Long story short; this is not a ful game release this is an early acces title. Those who bought at full retail price [like me] are scammed. Especially considering they gave the game major discounts after launch [and even given people the oppertunity to play a very long time for free with gamepass].

Normally early acces titles are cheaper at launch, increase in price as time goes on/the game gets more content and improvements. This is clearly the other way around."
PAYDAY 3,1272080,178290578,"I bought this because of Yukinoshita Peo's sponsor stream. Have never played the Payday series before, but it looks like a lot of fun with friends, and the updates make it feel better than before."
PAYDAY 3,1272080,178483246,"Sorry guys, but after a whole year, it's still not worth it. I know I should probably spend more time with this, but it's genuinely so fucking boring. I can't get behind you guys if there's no content or consideration for the average player not paying for every piece of content. Payday 2 already had huge content drops throughout its first year cycle. No Crimefest, no nothing. Horribly optimised still, both in game and networking, and a UI fix won't bring the game around.

You guys seriously dropped the ball on this. And hearing about an upcoming game already, whilst resources are already spread so thin, you guys will be done when 2026 rolls.

If you're already into the payday franchise you might find some great fun in this game. But for the average Joe, this is not it. Payday 2 was a lightning in a bottle and this is not one of them. More free content, better optimisation and networking, and for god sake, make the heists memorable guys. This is a pathetic sight to see after all the begging for payday 2 money, wasting it, and repeat. I'm never supporting you guys on this ridiculous cult bullshit again.

Mark my words. Starbreeze will be gone when that game drops. Walking dead all over again. And if Starbreeze doesn't exist, then same goes for the game.

Payday 2 literally laid out every foundation you needed, and you wasted it as always."
PAYDAY 3,1272080,178204142,"I would genuinely recommend this game after all the QoL updates. It is so fun and very reminiscent of Payday The Heist. These updates have gone a long way to improve the game. With that being said, this game still has it's fair share of issues, and it might be a while before the game reaches it's true potential. But I see the vision and I genuinely am rooting for this game to succeed and reach the peaks that Payday 2 did. Would highly recommend this game if you can get it on sale."
PAYDAY 3,1272080,178619009,"Major bugs still exist.

One example is being unable to queue after every game, you have to restart in order to play again."
PAYDAY 3,1272080,178253503,Disastrous (predictable) launch. I waited a year to get the game +Year 1 DLC for $38 and I still felt robbed. None of the soul that made PDTH or PAYDAY 2 special is here. This is a game designed by a committee that either didn't like or didn't care about the previous games. It's a mash of mechanics from other (more popular) games that were added in lieu of having a single original thought on the game series they inherited. Refunded after 4 hours.
PAYDAY 3,1272080,178196061,"Is now a good time to pick up PAYDAY 3? Yes.
If you left after the disastrous launch a year ago, or you were waiting for more content and QoL features to be added, now is a good time to get back in the game.
Year 1 Edition offers all DLCs and right now you can get it with a nice discount.
PAYDAY 3 could really use new and returning players, so devs can continue supporting it.
Give it a try!"
PAYDAY 3,1272080,178767201,After 1 year the game is finally worth buying and deserves a second chance.
PAYDAY 3,1272080,178681161,"Decided to give it a try after ca. a year of PD3 being released.
Why no?

- Extra Account. WTF?!
- Off-line was postponed and now is still buggy.
- Run-time networking is buggy.
- Always difficulties with matchmaking.
- On normal difficulty, enemies are sponges. In PD2, it was funny to shoot'em all in the head. In PD3, I sometimes need 2 headshots with a shotgun to a regular enemy point blank.
- With a decent PC build, it freezes way too often.
- I didn't get Grit/Edge/Rush mechanic.
- UI is boring and mediocre. It doesn't have a soul like PD2 had.

I just wanted PD2 with next-gen graphics. It's not. And not going to happen any time soon, I presume."
PAYDAY 3,1272080,177786086,"As of this writing Payday 3 is a worthy successor of Payday 2. I will skip the issue at launch pretty much everyone knows what happened there. What’s important is the team working on this game has listen to feedback and put a lot of effort into getting this game where is needed to be. If the game launched today in its current state, it would be top / rated top seller. If anyone has their doubts still, I can ensure you this is the time to jump in. I will say that I feel its best to Buy Gold, or the upcoming Year 1 edition. Not to say the base game is not worth it, but if you’re coming off Payday 2 which has over a decade of content, you might find the base game light on content. I'm really excited to see where this one will be in 10 years like the past game, it can only get better and better."

FINAL FANTASY XIV ONLINE,39210,177533875,"So I've played more MMO's than I'm happy to admit with countless hours wasted always trying to find the right one.. Not to mention the money spent on each one. 

This one is the one. 

High points:
-Voice actors
-Sideqquests and main quests aren't boring gopher tasks
-Long and interesting main story
-Player housing

Cons:
-Not enough voice acting
-God awful launcher for first launch and account creation + payment, etc.

Absolute dumpster fire first launch, and then figuring out the SE account stuff and how to pay to play... Just the worst experience out of ALL MMO's I played.. But by far the funnest gameplay. All this game is making me wish, is that WoW was a better game than it is and there was a point to play it. Maybe one day I'll return, maybe sooner if added to steam.. But as for now, I see thousands of hours being spent on this one and it becoming my main MMO."
FINAL FANTASY XIV ONLINE,39210,178427482,"I'm in my mid-40s, and have never played an online game until last year. I'd heard too many horror stories, and honestly, I was worried I wouldn't be able to manage the keyboard controls. My left hand is mostly brain dead. 

I jumped into gaming last year for Palia. While there's a much longer story to be told there, I will just say that the thing I was doing to try to relax and escape from the hellish timeline we're all living in, became more frustration than fun, more exasperation than escape. I stuck with it for a bit over a year, still hoping it would eventually become what the OG team had promoted. 

It won't. Not ever. 

So I asked some other players what game I should try next, and the most overwhelmingly consistent response was FFXIV. 

I started the free trial last week. I was terrified of the combat, and of having so many new things to learn, but found myself sucked in, all the same. Now, I will unashamedly say I am hooked through the bag. 

The story is captivating, and keeps me on the edge of my seat as I progress through the MSQ and gradually piece together the epic, sweeping history of Eorzea and all her climes and cultures, magic and mystery. I care about the world and the races that dwell within it, and want to know everything they will tell me. I care about how my efforts are intertwined with the main conflict that propels the plot forward and outward in an ever expanding, ever shifting, inescapably immersive lore.

The artwork for both characters and landscapes is mind boggling in its beauty, complexity, and variety. For the first week, I don't think I've managed to play for a single hour without gasping in awe as I summit some new horizon and experience a new part of Eorzea for the first time, or without grinning in delight at some tiny detail that I very nearly missed. 

The mechanics are immense, but masterfully introduced so that even the newbiest newb can fairly easily and almost entirely naturally learn as they play. Believe me, if I could understand all of the different systems in place in less than a week, anyone can. Yet those systems and mechanics, at least so far, don't feel stale or boring or rote, and there is always a challenge to be had for those who are driven by that need.

I've never reviewed a game before, and I definitely didn't intend to compose a novella, but I couldn't wait another moment to sing the praises of one of the most skillfully - and obviously passionately - created worlds I've ever encountered in any sort of fiction, in my 40+ years of reading fantasy and scif, and watching shows and movies in the same genres. 

I only wish I could rate it higher!

FINAL FANTASY XIV ONLINE,39210,178683783,"The account system management on this game is a joke.  Normal PC accounts don't merge with Steam accounts...except both are displayed.  They have the same password and login for some screens, but not others.  Theres 5 different websites to manage all of this.  They also enabled SSO, which is tied to I'm not sure which account, but I can never seem to get logged in, and end up having to do a password reset every time, because all of this confuses my password manager to no end.  I won't be giving this game another dime until they can fix this abysmal login system.  Also, why not just let me login through steam if its integrated with steam????????  This issue remains true for all version and expansions of this game."
FINAL FANTASY XIV ONLINE,39210,178458100,"The game has plenty of old content to keep you busy for years!
The MSQ is worthwhile up to a point and very immersive and engaging.
The community are willing to give new players help to learn the ropes and there's always something different, interesting or downright disturbing happening in the party finder at most hours.
However, this and the last expansion have been a major drop off for me and I've lost a good amount of friends who didn't return for DT because of the lack luster output of content during EW, and after the friends I remained in contact with heard about the mess that they made of the MSQ with DT they don't look like they'll be returning at all.
EW's MSQ was amazing! But I feel that SE let us down with a huge lack of content, which was stingy at best. And at least in my opinion and many who I've spoken to, DT let us down BADLY with the worst MSQ of any of the previous expansions by far.
The long dry spells of new content are too long, and at one point I felt, with how popular the game had gotten that they'd be releasing more content with each expansion, not less and more of the same...
I fail to see where the subs are going cos it's not going back into this title the way it should be in order to keep their customers busy and coming back.
It's the same timetable as the last two expansions, same amount of dungeons, all be them a little more difficult than the yawn fests of the last two expansions but they've very quickly gotten boring as well.
Overall it just looks like they're doing the bare minimum to keep their player base somewhat satisfied to fund other stuff on the side and it's been showing for a while now.
Do better SE as I feel that the MSQ will not be bringing people back this time."

If you can be patient with these parts you will get to play a fun silly mmo that has a lot of different enjoyable parts to it.

You can play a lot of the game in the free trial, but it does take a subscription to have access to the market board (auction house), pvp, houses, retainers (extra bag/inventory space), and to get rid of the 300,000 gil (money) cap.  The main story gets better with the expansions.  The action is pretty good.  Customization is solid.  You can even play each class of adventurer and profession on one character (I think, anyway - haven't seen one that you can't, but I haven't done them all).  There is much to do, the community is nice, and I haven't seen real life political agenda being forced through the game."

Do you like having all classes and crafting jobs available on the same character with easy equipment set changing? Do you like an intricate crafting system with engaging interactive mechanics that could honestly be a game in themselves?

THEN DON'T TOUCH FINAL FANTASY XIV!

Don't get me wrong, it does have all of those things, but if they are what you are looking for, you're in for a rude awakening. Because the game is a story game first and foremost. It doesn't *also* have a story, as an option if you're interested. No, it IS a story game.

If you like stories and/or this story specifically? Cool! Amazing! From all I heard and what little I've seen, I think it's a great story and there's years and years of amazing story content to enjoy. If that's for you, you can stop reading, because this review isn't for you. But if you are anything like me, if the main thing you want out of this game is any or all of the things I mentioned initially and story is - at most - a nice little side dish you may want to dip into occasionally, then: This game isn't made for you.

You'll HAVE to play the story to very slowly, painstakingly pry access to those things you ACTUALLY want to do out of the game's claws. It doesn't want you to get there. Not before you know ~The Story~ of every little thing you get. Can't access a dungeon before knowing its historical relevance. Can't learn an ability without listening to some dude out in bumf*ck nowhere telling you how to attune your holy dragonsoul to the ancient teachings of ""finally I have combo finisher at level 30, now can I get a single AoE ability please"".

And don't believe skipping is a serious option. Sure, you can. But you gotta skip every speech bubble individually. Wait for them to finish their animations, because you can't skip those. Wait for every loading screen for a cutscene individually before you get to skip it. And once you skipped that, your reward is that you get to go to the other side of the world to talk to a guy, skip it all, then return - and then you'll do it again! (At least the teleporting ability is cheap and readily available everywhere...) The only serious skip is the paid full story skip up to the current expansion. However that's 20€ PLUS what you pay for the expansion + base game. A hefty sum for a game that seemingly doesn't even want people like us playing it.

Fights are rare in the Main Story Quest (MSQ), you're mostly just talking. Occasionally you're forced to go through a dungeon or raid, which is easy enough with the group finder - high levels will join you and get scaled down, so there's always enough people around - but to me it's still often a slap in the face. When I play, I play what I'm in the mood for. If I'm in the mood for dungeons, I do dungeons. If I'm in the mood for skipping through the story to maybe finally get ever so slightly closer to the endgame I crave, I don't want to suddenly do a raid.

Oh and just as an extra little f*ck you, if you're actually playing with somebody else, you'll regularly have to disband the group, because there's a lot of solo instanced content in the MSQ that you can't do with a group at all. Just dancing to the whims of the designers - one second you need to be alone, one second you need 23 other people with you.

While leveling, side quests - and arguably also dungeons and any other content at some point - are *mechanically* useless, because if you're not focusing the MSQ hard, you'll quickly outlevel your content. It's not a *problem* technically, because you'll just get scaled down and can still participate. You'll even still level up. But there's no actual progress. Being max level is completely useless if you didn't do the COMPLETE MSQ FOR THE BASEGAME AND EVERY SINGLE EXPANSION to unlock all the content for max level. You can't even go to those areas without getting to that point in the MSQ.

I'm 150h in at this point (if you're doing the math: 40h were on the free demo) and I'm allegedly close to finishing the BASEGAME story quest. (I still don't fully believe it, because I was allegedly close to it 50h ago already.) And that's with skipping most story content - first out of disinterest, then out of spite. Though admittedly, I took longer breaks to just do dungeons (even without the xp being of any use), get into crafting (which is actually REALLY cool) and leveling other classes to keep myself sane.

But still, while it can be done faster: Even if you plan to skip the whole story, it will be a soulless GRIND. Walk to some guy, skip skip skip skip. Skip cutscene, skip skip skip. Teleport to the other side of the world. Walk/ride a bit because next guy isn't close to the teleporter. Skip skip skip skip. Skip cutscene. And you'll do that for hours. This game can't even give you a CRAFTING quest without 10 speech bubbles of story content.

I'm too deep in. I got a taste of what the game can do. I hate crafting in other games, I love it here. While I still prefer combat mechanics in other games, I really want to get into this one deeper, because it is definitely very good. And last but not least... my girlfriend plays and loves this game and I really, really, really want to get to a point where I can share that enjoyment with her. I see why she does, I just can't quite reach it yet...

I can't let this game go, but hell... it's draining. The designers have built great mechanics that I love and want to explore and yet I have to fight them every step to be allowed access to them. One thing is very clear: They designed a story game. Not a mechanics game. And if you don't submit to the story they want to tell, you'll suffer.

It might be worth it. I sure hope it will be at some point. I'm sure the story is good too, if you're willing to engage with it. But I wasn't and by now I'm too spiteful and jaded. So much so that I can't even buy the story skip. The idea of rewarding this design that feels so intentionally hostile towards me specifically with extra money makes my blood boil.

If you're still here, I hope this read was worth it, too. For me it was honestly mostly therapeutical. Trying to get it off my chest, hoping to find the motivation to continue trying. If it helped you, I'm glad."

Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178142535,"Waited 9 years for a new instalment of Dragon Age series, one of my all time favourite game franchises! I've always been a fan of Bioware games, like Mass Effect, and OG Baldur's Gate. And I replayed ALL the DA games ready and in anticipation of DAV. I am both saddened and mad at the state of this game!! 

Lets start off with the things I'm glad about:

- Romance any of the companions (honestly felt that this should have been in all the games) 
- Better hair styles
- Even on lowest graphics it looks like DAI on ultra (though that was 10 years old at this point) 
- You can pet cats and dogs you find in your travels, not all but some (edit)

Cons:

- Characters feel samey - they really don't have anything to distinguish themselves from each other, and feel very much like a click where everyone loves everyone and gets alone with no issues.
- Back to DAO days of corridor running
- Puzzles are lacking/non-existent
- Combat is dull, boring and lacks skills to use on the battlefield - by this in DAI you could have up to 8 skills on your hot bar when using controller and still be able to command your party. You get one less companion and only 3 skills this time round, making combat a ""smash x to win""
- No dalish option for your character if your run elf - this feels like a HUGE miss 
- Lack of character development for both PC and companions
- No real renegade options - I miss being able to choose if i wanted a lawful good run or just pure chaos
- approval system is just pointless 
- Lore completely retconned - Everything I knew about DA (literally replayed all 3 games so many times cos of my love for the games) was thrown out of a window and stamped on. Feels more like a 12 year old girl's fanfic than a real lore driven game. 
- Story lack luster, feels all choices I made in previous games to create a world state was pointless, and while I understand after all this time would be hard to integrate DAV in to something like DragonsKeep I feel they should have given us more choices to add in that would MATTER to the game state. Not only that the story feels stale, uninteresting and just weak. Even DA2 was better than this and we all know that had a weak story with bad pacing, this is 100% times worse!!
- I felt patronised as a player by how the characters talked down to me even Varric when that has never been his personality.
- Character assassinated previous characters from how they speak, to how they behaved.
- This is not a ""progressive"" game, the original 3 games where progressive, this felt very regressive and a lot of pointless real world politics added in a distasteful way, that it was uncomfortable for me to play through, and I'm a female, bisexual, demisexual, disabled person that is usually all for progressive games, instead this was not what I got. Instead I was forced to endure very patronising cutscenes and waste time on things that have no bareings on a world ending crisis/story line. 
- Character creation, while better than previous instalments, was still bad. No matter how hard I tried to make my lady elf look good she still felt like a man in the face. Body I couldn't care less about, as the body wasn't really an option in previous games, always the same body shape and we always had gender neutral armour on anyway so I didn't care, but the face... Good gosh that was aweful... 
- Heads of all characters STILL look too large, body proportions where all over the place and looked odd and wonky. Just over all not a fan of this more cartoon look, but I could have lived with this IF this was the only con. 

Over all this has been one of the most uncomfortable games I've played through. I was so desperate for a new DA game, that I preordered the deleux edition of this game, and was so excited for this. As I mentioned earlier in this, it really does feel like someone's fanfic, that removes everything they disliked about DA (so all of the set lore and previous story) and wrote how they felt the game should end. I wish I could defend this game but I really can't and it breaks my heart. This was meant to be a continuation of the already outlined story from the first 3 games instead this doesn't even feel like the same franchise anymore. 

I get the old DA devs didn't work on this game (they don't even work at Bioware anymore) so I expected some changes/retcons, but this... This is a terrible joke, and a F--- you to the fans. The game has 0 idea what it is telling, what it wants to be, or anything. I feel at this point the game would have been better recieved had they started from scratch with Origins and rebooted the series OR better yet, just created a whole new franchise, new story and stayed away from a beloved franchise. I am usually fine with changes in games/stories but there needs to be a reason for it, it needs to be better than what came before, even if its just testing waters and flops. But I can't sit here and defend or excuse what this mess is.

While I doubt my view will change, I still plan to finish this game to see how much else has been ruined, I will NEVER recommend this game, and I pray no one buys this game as a loud message needs to be set to companies about pulling these stunts."
Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178165997,"PROS:
- best looking hair I've ever seen in a game
- gorgerous environments
- I actually do like the character designs
- some of the writing is cute and makes me laugh
- some characters have pretty good voice acting
- can pet cats
- the game actually works on release (sad that it's a plus at this point, but, yanno)

NEUTRAL:
- combat is meh, some will like it, some will not, I didn't mind it
- video-gamey map design, why the f are there ziplines in cities bro

CONS:
- boring music, might as well not be there
- braindead puzzles, take them out and you lose nothing, WHY ARE THEY THERE
- at least half of the dialogue is atrocious, I cringe way too often
- voice acting is subpar, especially on Neve's character 
- KBM controls are annoyingly consolified
- camera gets hijacked all the time
- infantile writing at times that does not match the tone of the situation the characters are in
- facial animation is bad
- feels clunky
- UI is a wreck of glowing things that draw your attention for no reason (why does the level show up every time I gain exp, WHY)
- not enough Solas
- First Big Choice writing was so bad I damn near quit on the spot
- the vibe of the whole thing is off, why are they all so cheery, why are their problems so dumb, WORLD IS BLOODY ENDING, ACT LIKE IT
- there's something off with targeting

bioware is NOT back."
Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178412485,"I beat the game. It took about 62 hours to do so and my biggest takeaway from this game is that this isn't a BioWare game. 

BioWare made it's name on ""your choices matter"", then boiled down 200 hours of content down to three questions and destroyed every former region in what feels like a scorched earth attempt to say ""We're done here, stop asking about things from Origins/2/Inquisition because they're dead and now there's no going back"" and that nothing that we did in those three previous games mattered because it's all gone now anyway. 

It feels BAD. It feels like a betrayal and sellout for a modern take and a fresh audience who aren't going to care about those things. If you're new to the franchise, you may enjoy it, the combat is formatted to align with more modern games and if the vibes match what you want, then go for it, but if you're a longtime Dragon Age fan looking forward to this game, my biggest and most stern recommendation is to not play it. It will not meet your expectations and will ruin what love you had remaining for the company. 

Go back and play Origins instead."
Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178127744,"I will edit this review if my opinion changes as I play. I am 4 hours in and I still don't feel like the game has started. My immersion in a Dragon Age game has legitimatly never been lower than these 4 hours. Player agency is non existent, I don't feel like I've gotten any opportunity to RP, or develop my character at all. I have no idea who this dude is, I don't feel like a part of the world, and the characters all blur together into a singular lifeless entity. Everything feels like a set, you get plopped into scenes at a rapid pace with no chance to explore. There has genuinely never been another game in the series that has felt so completely on rails and uninterested in letting the player actually interact with it. And the dialogue. Oh god. Not even just the player's, which is abysmal, but the dialogue in general is written so badly. Characters repeat themselves over, and over again like you're too stupid to have heard them the first time. Here is an example of what I mean (paraphrased but the gist is there): 

Character A: we’re searching for the Nadas Dirthalan! It’s an archive spirit. 
Character B: Nadas Dirthalan?
Character A: Yes! It’s a spirit that can tell us all about the ancient elves history!

A few minutes later

Character A: We’re close to the Archive Spirit! I have so many questions to ask it. 

Another few minutes later, we meet it, it disappears.

Character B: Well it’s broken like all the other artifacts here.
Character A: it’s not just any artifact! It’s the Nadas Dirthalan! The Archive Spirit! I have so many questions to ask it!

*fade to black, teleported to new location* 

Character A: blah blah something something Nadas Dirthalan
Character C: Wait! You met the Nadas Dirthalan? The Archive Spirit? We could ask it about the ancient elven gods!

If they aren't repeating exposition/objectives at you, they're using the most corny and predictable filler dialogue. How many times have you heard ""It's quiet here... TOO QUIET."" cuz it's got that. I wouldn't be surprised to hear a ""He's standing right behind me isn't he"" or a ""Well that just happened."" I guess this is what we're left with when EA decides to fire their best writers for the series.

8 hours in and I still couldn't tell you a single thing about these characters beyond one or two word descriptions. I could list a fact or two about them, but I really am getting absolutely no personality off them. Everyone feels so cardboard. The only character with a shred of personality is almost entirely due to the talent of the voice actress portraying her, working hard with a piss poor script. 

Part of me feels awful, hating this game so much. I want to make it clear that zero of the reasons to hate this game have to do with inclusion or ""wokeness."" I wish people would stop making it about that, it's a nothing criticism, it's an entirely artificial conflict, and it's made the fanbase into yes men who refuse to look at the game critically or accept anything but praise for what is so obviously a lazy game devoid of anything that made these games compelling. To the people who decry this game out of bigotry alone: the Dragon Age series has always included explicit queer identity and giving the player more options to express that aspect of their own character is a positive in my book. Having more LGBT characters or options for players to explore their own character's identity in a game does nothing to you. Get over yourself. Unfortunately, it's in a shit game that has no place calling itself part of what was an incredible trilogy, and yes, for all of DA2's short comings, it is still leagues better than this game. There is a STARK contrast between the two, actually. DA2 had a ridiculously rushed production, had ambitions it couldn't deliver on because of executive meddling and STILL managed to tell an incredible story with rich, memorable characters. And then those talented writers got fired or left, and we got to wait an entire decade for a polished turd."
Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178471113,"Dragon Age The Veilguard is a lot like Mass Effect Andromeda, arguably the best combat in the series, (Although I much prefer my RTWP) Stunning graphics and environmental design, and never feels cumbersome to actually play. But, also like Andromeda, Veilguard suffers from abysmal, sterilized, and insultingly safe writing, little to no actual ability to shape your character's personality, and a complete disconnection to choices and events of past games in the series which made sense for Andromeda with the whole switching galaxies thing. 

Veilguard almost feels afraid to mention any of the past games in a meaningful way, Characters like Morrigan and Harding who return don't feel or look like themselves, Harding in particular feeling 10 years younger than herself in Inquisition, returning characters can only mention past games in a vague way, you can't ask any of these characters any thing worthwhile.  BioWare throws away one of their more interesting villains in Solas in the first 10 minutes of the game just to be replaced by 2 generically and cartoonishly evil bad guys. 

I wish Steam allowed mixed review scores for times like this because their is truly a good game here for people, but this feels like a spit in the face for me and lot of fans who have been waiting 10 years for the culmination and finale of 3 entire games worth of story lines and character arcs."
Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178399292,"Edit: I turned on easy mode and cleared the game. Finished all companion quests and got what I'd consider the ""best"" ending possible. My takeaway is that this is a game written for nobody. This is a reboot billed as a sequel: It REQUIRES knowledge of the series for it's plot to have any emotional impact - yet constantly goes out of it's way to show it's contempt for the lore and previous entries. How could this please anyone? Dragon Age was my first exposure to the Fantasy genre, I care deeply for these stories - and at this point I just hope they don't parade it's corpse around again.

To clarify, I'm not some oldhead DAO purist or a grifter. Origins, 2, and Inquisition all have their respective major faults - but I could always look past them, when the world and story was crafted with such love and care. Veilguard in comparison is soulless drivel, lacking in any nuance. It's unwilling to present any real emotional or intellectual conflict to the player - in a setting that, in many ways, is defined by it's ability to evoke these feelings. 


I got past the simplification of combat.
I got past the cartoon Darkspawn.

But the writing is an insult to anyone that has had any investment in Dragon Age as a series. 

The phrase “marvel tier writing” is overused, but it does apply here. It’s not that quippy dialogue is inherently bad. It’s that everything they’ve presented, be it dialogue, lore exposition, all of it - is HEAVILY sanitized. In far too many instances, the writing is amateurishly immersion breaking. It feels like HR is present in the background of every interaction. This isn't targeting inclusivity. Dragon Age has always been vocally inclusive and I love it for that - but Veilguard is so hamfisted it proves itself the most regressive of all 4 entries. 

Each returning character feels like a half-baked cardboard cutout, a caricature. Why even bring Morrigan or Dorian back if you’re going to strip them of everything that connected us as players to their stories. These moments that should be amazing - seeing these characters again after 10 years, don’t just fall flat - they feel like an insult to the characters themselves.

A lot of blame is deservedly placed on corporate level decisions, but when your writing staff is so fundamentally out of touch with the setting - there was no hope in the first place.

DA2 did it in the same 3 caves with a box of scraps (and like 1/15th of the dev time)

“Did you think you mattered, Hawke? Did you think anything you ever did mattered?”"
Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178237923,"Disappointment and wasted potential:

The good:
Runs very well, very smooth, not a single bug or stutter in 12 hours of gameplay.
The visual design of the levels and environments and the atmosphere of the big set pieces. They look and feel big and apocalyptic.
Character creation, visually has alot of options and room to make your PC look the way you want. Hair in particular looks very lifelike.

The bad:
The Combat - Is mediocre at best, whilst the visuals and animations are quite flashy, it feels like a dumbed down version of Inquisitions combat. It gets boring and repetitive within a few hours. I turned the difficulty down after a few hours so I could get through it more quickly. Gone is the tactical combat and engineered party synergy of previous games.

The Story - Feels like it has the skeleton of compelling, intriguing narrative full of secrets revlealed, moral ambiguity and challenging decisions. However it's like it's been simplified to the level of a child's cartoon or a by the numbers phase 4 Marvel movie. This get's so frustrating because there are so many points that have the glimmer of a truly great and compelling RPG, but at every turn it feels like they fall short and fail to realise that potential. The DA setting has been built up as such well realised world with a compelling history full of mystery. Veilguard reveals answers alot of those mysteries but how they do it cheapens and taints everything that came before.

The Gear - Reminds me of a bad Korean MMO. Combine duplicate gear to upgrade it and give it more stats? Really? Where's the going on an epic quest to find a legendary sword etc? The immersion and investment?

The Worst:
The Characters & Dialogue - This is what I expect to be the high point of a Bioware game. So many times they have created compelling, well drawn casts of characters that form a web of friendship, rivalry, romance etc that I couldnt help but get entangled in. In this Veilguard fails completely. Many of the characters have alot of potential and interesting concepts, but it's rolled flat by childish, wooden dialogue. Solas is the only character that is interesting at all and much of that I suspect is just because of the build up of the previous game. This is the biggest disappointment, the game totally failed to make me invested in any of the characters in any way. The might as well have been characters in a commercial.

Conclusion:
As a fan of the series this is a huge disappointment. Ever since finishing Inquisition I've looked forward to this game yet now I've had to stop playing around 13 hours in because the game has just become a tiresome chore. Given that I replayed each of the previous installments multiple times (even DA2!). Worse this actively taints the previous games, knowing where all the tension and mystery they build is headed.

Give this one a miss unless its on a massive discount. If you're interested in the story just watch it on youtube."
Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178146219,"EDIT: After four hours, my opinion of the game has only gotten worse. You can tell that this was a live service game at one point. The combat and abilities feel very MMO-like, and they have a floaty-ness that feels unsatisfying. A lot of my other opinions are spoilers, so I'll leave those on the table...Fans of Origins are going to be frustrated, though.

Original Review:

It's...fine. Just fine. I'm going to get into some spoilers for Inquisition in this review, and some very minor spoilers for the first hour or so of Veilguard. You've been warned.

Look, I'm a software engineer myself. When I play this game, I can tell that the team behind it worked WONDERS behind the scenes. This is one of the single most stable AAA games released in years -- It's definitely way more stable than Inquisition was when it was released. I've yet to encounter any serious bugs. The frame pacing is stellar. Even with Ultra Ray Tracing enabled, the game just RUNS. It's a technical marvel what they've been able to do with Frostbite -- an engine that used to have a reputation for being impossible to work with if you weren't making a Battlefield game. On a technical level, this product is really something to be proud of. 

But we don't come to Dragon Age for its technical prowess, do we? I haven't played much yet, so I'm going to give this game a chance. If by the end of the game it manages to change my mind, I'll come up and update this review. But, ultimately, this game has fumbled the story on a fundamental level, and I think most Dragon Age fans are going to come away frustrated.

Your character comes out of nowhere. Literally nowhere. That gameplay demo that they showed off a couple months back? That is the start of the game. Nothing happens before you. You're already buddies with Varric. You're already on board with the core conflict of the game. The game makes no effort to set up any reason that YOU, Rook, specifically have an investment in this conflict beyond ""Saving The World."" 

In Inquisition, and Dragon Age: Origins, you were an unwilling participant in the events that make you a hero. In Origins, you were living a mostly happy life until something goes horribly wrong, and you're forced to run away with the Gray Wardens. Then they all die, and you're left the only person left who can save the world.

In Inquisition, you were an attendee at a summit between the Chantry and Mages that was trying to resolve the conflict of Dragon Age 2 (Which I'm leaving out of this discussion because its status among the community is...complicated). The summit is blown to pieces, and you're left with a rift to the veil on your hand as tears begin to open up all over the world. You're the only person with the ability to close these rifts, and so you have to step up and do something. And even if you weren't the only one, you have the mystery of what happened to you as a driving factor.

In Veilguard? Well, you're just kind of there. Presumably Varric dug you out of a gutter somewhere, started doing some missions with you, and by the time the game starts you are somehow aware of everything that's going on and are fully on board with your role in stopping it all. 

And...That's BAFFLING to me. Dragon Age isn't like Mass Effect. They've never carried over the protagonist between games, but to account for that, they ensured that the core conflict of each game was uniquely yours. You were living out a new chapter in the history of Thedas. Your decisions in previous games helped set the stage for you, but you had your OWN motivations for doing what you were doing.

In the Veilguard, the conflict isn't Rook's. It's the Inquisitor's. Solas was one of the inquisitor's closest friends and confidants, and he went on an entire globe-spanning adventure with them in order to save the world. Then, after you've done so...you realize that he was behind everything all along. He was secretly an immortal god of the Elves that created the veil to seal away his fellow gods, tearing magic out of the world and rendering everyone -- and most notably his fellow Elves -- mortal. Thousands of years later, he regrets what he has done and wants to unsever the world and return it to the wonderous state it was in before. He fumbles that at first, and the villain of the main game gets ahold of the MacGuffin that he was going to use to do that...But when you stop him, Solas is now free to pursue other avenues to achieve his goals -- at the cost of countless lives. But he hadn't counted on coming to know you. In finding your companionship.

In the closing act of Inquisition, you are left helplessly confronting Solas as he lays out everything that he is planning, and then he leaves you there to sit with that betrayal. If you are an elf woman, and you romanced Solas, the scene is particularly powerful -- You realize at the same time that Solas is the god that your people abhor, and the person that set in motion the events that set your life ablaze. But you still love him. And you beg him to listen to you, and find another way. But then he leaves. And you swear to follow.

----

And then you don't. Some new smuck does. Bioware has made the decision to continue the conflict from Inquisition, with all of the emotional baggage that comes with it, but they remove all of the people that were involved in that conflict and have something to say about it aside from a handful of returning characters that seem pretty minor so far. This random new smuck is the one confronting Solas for what he did. This random new smuck is the one to chase him down and stop him. And it feels extremely hollow. The story that they are trying to tell is BEGGING for the Inquisitor to be the main character. And I think the developers realize that. In the first 10 minutes of the game, when you confront Solas for the first time...YOU don't do anything, Varric does. Why? Because, however tenuous, Varric has SOME history with Solas, and you have none. You can't confront him because none of that pain is yours...And honestly, not much of it is Varric's either. This game is BEGGING for the Inquisitor to be the one standing there, trying to talk him down.

But for whatever reason, they shot themselves in the foot and made what could have been an incredibly powerful story incredibly hollow by having some random unknown be the person to tie off those threads. Hell, even if they didn't want to bring the Inquistor back, they could have at least spent SOME TIME setting up your character's motivations for being there. Maybe Solas' plans intersect with your life in some way, and now you're the next unwilling participant in your own Dragon Age adventure. But they didn't even do that much. You're some dude that Varric scooped up off the street and set to work solving his problems...And you don't even get to see that much. You're just there. You have a mission. You're a badass. You may have never met him, but you sure do know that this Solas guy needs to be stopped.

I've only played the intro so far, but I felt so incredibly burned by how they decided to set up this game that I feel like it's going to color my thoughts about it going forward. They needed to:

A. Make Solas tangential to the adventure, and give your character his own inciting incident and role in this world.

OR 

B. Make this game a direct sequel to Inquisition, and the Inquisitor the main character.

Instead they tried to mash together a little from column A and column B, and made something that is SO far all around disappointing.

I really hope that this was just an extremely bad introduction to the game and that it gets better. If it does, I'll update this review. But I'm honestly really bummed. This isn't how I wanted the follow up to Dread Wolf to go."
Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178315545,"Out of all the (idiotic) controversies, out of all the changes in gameplay, out of every decision to simplify the story (Yes, I have been playing since Origins) know that I couldn't give a damn for the integrity. Every DA game has been different since the beginning, and I'm fine with everything changing, but this one breaks the cardinal rule which made me quit.

It doesn't trust me.

This game reeks of insecurity, both in its gameplay and storytelling. ""Look, coming in on your left."", ""Oh wow, this is so amazing."", ""That's one point to Rook"". Stop telling me how to do things, where I go, how I'm MEANT to feel. Let me get lost in this world. 

Unfortunately, every step is meant to make sure that I don't miss the story beats THEY want. This isn't my story anymore, it's someone elses."
Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178390293,"The combat was fun for a time but for a RPG the dialogue and writing ruins the entire game. Its obvious to see the writers have no life experience to draw from since much of the story feels as if it was generated by an AI.

The world is falling apart around you and everyone is unbearably nice about it. Should you choose the ""evil"" option on the dialogue wheel (which is just pragmatism), characters will go as far as to apologise on your behalf should you be too mean.

 There is no sense of urgency in the world and the first major choice in the game came at completely the wrong time. It's impossible to spoil the story, as its terrible, but you are given a choice, between companions and cities. Which one will you help? However the writers, voice artists or world building made no effort to create any attachments to one or the other. Enough to make you hover over the uninstall button and wish you got this game on EA Play. 

You are in a fantasy world that is open for you to explore. However the developers decided to use only exposition after exposition after more exposition to explain this world to you. Between this exposition dialogue you and your companions will constantly pat each other on the back and lie to each other about how awesome the other is. 

Class choices are boring and the abilities of your companions makes you miss the older games that allowed you to control them directly. For instance I wanted a griffon and the abilities it came with but I am forced to drag around a boring character if I want to access that. Companions are only good for their combo abilities. They will often disengage targets or the enemies they do target will still attack you. 

There are many things I could nitpick at, like the warden elf with a cleft lip speaking french randomly or any number of inconsistencies. 

If you do want to waste your time. Get this in a sale."
Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178114706,"I'm a diehard dragon age/bioware fan, i've been playing all their games since neverwinter nights and jade empire.
Dragon age origins was a masterpiece, the sequel was great(i dont mind the action gameplay) and i enjoyed inquisition.

But i'm 2 hours in, and a few problems already arise.
The world has dissappeared from this game, every character feels like they went to the same school, same village, we're just running on crash bandicoot tracks, every companion is joking even though the world is ending, and people are supposedly dying everywhere.

I hope this gets more dragon-agey, but initial impression is bad, the immersion is not there yet.

I feel out of place with this character, a nobody who just happens to make friends and meet every npc from the previous games x.x feels like cheap cameos in a railroaded movie, rather than characters you can have a meaningful interaction with.

What's this ""starting out as an allknowing hero"" when every dragon age game has been a game about slowly being introduced to the world through your character. It feels like Rook might aswell have been the inquisitor from DA:I, since he/she is so determined to save the world, despite having no real connection to it.

At this point i feel like assassin's creed has better dialogue options and choices."
Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178254788,"I really hate it. I'm 7 hours in, I've avoided reviews and videos in order to give the game it's fair shot, but I regret buying this game. It plays like a child's game, the new art style is giving me the uncanny valley effect, and I don't care about any of these characters. Every fight is tedious and boring, and as gorgeous as the world is, it feels empty because of how little you interact with it and how very linear the game is. There is no free roaming on the same scale as the other games, no fun little NPC interactions, and it's been painfully sanitized to the point where I forget it isn't rated E. It doesn't feel like a dragon age game, I feel like I'm watching a badly done Disney cartoon while Bioware is holding my hand and spoon feeding me air and condescension. I usually finish a game before I review, but I just can't force myself to keep playing this, which breaks my heart after the solid 10 year wait. I've opened this game twice. I just wanted to speed run through the last quest I was doing because I truly and from the bottom of my heart did not want to play this game, which is not something that happens very often."
Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178152596,"Some parts of the story have been cool, but the writing is incredibly pedantic, the characters have to vocalize Every. Single. Thing, and continually state the obvious and exposite and repeating what has already been said or implied. 

Honestly, I don't think I've played a game with writing so bad that it made me actually want *less* banter between companions, but here we are.

Also, one of the early characters talks like a kindergarten teacher.

And the voice acting is pretty bad.  There is a noticeable difference between the voice acting for new characters and for those who were in the other games. 

The art style, particularly the character and monster design, is also pretty terrible, though some of the environments look good.  I think it wouldn't but me so much if the writing was at least good, but between the writing and the art, it feels like it was made for children. I legit burst out laughing when I saw my first dark spawn.

The character motion and fighting feel weirdly floaty.  

Character proportions are really weird thanks to the word art style so everyone looks bizarre and stumpy.

Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178284113,"If you want a story-rich RPG with an interesting narrative and companions, go play Baldur's Gate because this ain't it chief. It's a decent game with great art direction (when it comes to locations) and flashy combat. My advise: wait for this to go on sale. Can't recommend this at full price."
Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178437007,I was looking forward to this game for a really long time. I'm very disappointed that they dropped the ball this hard. I probably wont be buying the new Mass Effect when it comes out. I'm done with game companies hiring people that aren't interested in making a story in the world that has been established. If you want to make your own game do that. Don't barge into someone else's story and rewrite it the way you would have done it.
Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178157945,"I'm a massive Dragon Age fan and I've loved them all since Origins, even 2, but after 11 hours in the Veilguard It saddens me to say that I can't help but feel disappointed. I bought this game against my better judgement in spite of the controversies and in spite of the scathing reviews from Skill Up and Mr Matty Plays because Dragon Age is my favourite gaming series. My first 3 hours were incredible and I was so happy that the game wasn't just not terrible, but actually good! However, after those frontloaded 3 hours, the cracks started to show and those cracks quickly turned into a gaping chasm of mediocrity and I started to realise those two creators told several truths in their reviews. I strongly recommend you check at least one of those out before you buy but, after my first 11 hours, these are MY initial thoughts:

[h2] The Good: [/h2]

[b] - Character Models: [/b] The stylised art was a point of apprehension for me but it grew on me within the first hour. Character models look great. It's easy to create a stunningly beautiful character in the CC and they look just as good in cutscenes which is already an improvement over previous titles. Hair options are awesome.

[b] - The Performance: [/b] Flawless. On my 4080 with everything set to Ultra and all the Ray Tracing, I've had zero hiccups. And so far I've seen no bugs and experienced no crashes. It's been a while since I could say that about a AAA release.

[b] - The Graphics: [/b] Environments look awesome. There was a puddle in the opening mission that blew me away. The reflections, the physics. Chef's kiss.

[h2] The Bad: [/h2]

[b] - Voice Acting: [/b] This is my biggest gripe with the game. It's just incredibly bad and the majority of NPC's have their lines delivered with little to no emotion. I hate talking to companions and NPCs. Neve's is particularly unforgivable given she's one of the first people you meet in the game. I checked out after meeting a character from the comics I had been looking forward to meeting in game for years. Her acting was so bad and her lines were delivered like an NPC quest giver in an MMO. This was the straw that broke the camel's back and caused me to turn off the game.

[b] - The Writing: [/b] It leaves a lot to be desired. Conversations end abruptly as if the writer didn't know where it was going or simply where to take it and often left me asking, ""that's it?"". When my companions give their companion quest, they'll literally say one line of dialogue, giving my Rook no chance to respond and the conversation ends, and a quest is added to my journal. I feel like my Rook barely speaks and when she does, I feel no connection to her as a character. She feels like a passenger in her own story.

[b] - Nuance: [/b] 
Continuing my criticism of the writing I want to bring up self-doubt as it feels like all of my companions have it as does my Rook. The game has just begun and it feels like there's no reason for this. There was a scene early on where my Rook looked in a mirror and reminisced about her past. It became apparent she had self-esteem issues and there was an interesting option where I could talk about my tattoos. This would've been fine if the dialogue options didn't say something cliché like ""this is part of who I am"". As a tattooed person, this came across very forced and I've never once relied on my tattoos for self-esteem. I had a conversation with Varric where every line amounted to ""I can't do this, Varric, I need advice"". I wanted some degree of self confidence in my hero where doubt comes in later in the story due to a major setback. In Mass Effect Shepard began to doubt themself after Virmire, toward the latter part of the game. There was context for this because Virmire felt like a big failure and the bad guy got away. It then took the advice of a squadmate to uplift them and spur them to action. This common story beat instead takes place at the beginning of The Veilguard and it's jarring.

[b] - Side Quests: [/b] I did one side quest and I really don't want to do another one again.

[b] - Squad Balance: [/b] I picked a mage and I'm yet to recruit a single warrior. The game is linear and so far I have 2 mages, including my Rook, and 3 rogues, only one of which is melee focused. Did they assume everybody was going to pick Warrior? As a result my squad is imbalanced and I'm currently serving as my squad's tank. I'm forced to pick electric spells as a necessity because it's the only way I can prime detonations with the current selection party members. I'm particularly annoyed by this because I didn't want to RP as a lightning mage.

[b] - Mission Structure: [/b] It's disjointed. At first it had the linearity of God of War then transitioned into what I seemed like it would be a Mass Effect 2 mission structure but it didn't quite land. It's something really weird that I can't explain and it doesn't feel enjoyable.

[b] - Puzzles: [/b] Some puzzles do require more thinking than Matty and Skill Up gave the impression of. But I don't enjoy them and they feel like unnecessary additions. Not fun, more tedious than anything

[b] - Previous Choices: [/b] Obviously being a fan of all previous games, my choices not carrying over is a huge negative that I was willing to look past if the game was good. So far nothing has been so great as to justify this baffling decision.

[h2] The Ugly: [/h2]

[b] - Combat: [/b] It's fantastic. Mage gameplay feels like a better Hogwarts Legacy and this is the best the mage class has felt in a Dragon Age game! I've played every single Dragon Age on Nightmare, but this one feels a lot easier. I don't feel like the game is well-balanced because there was an insane difficulty spike when I went on a mission to recruit one of the companions. After that mission it went back to being ridiculously easy again. It took me 4 hours before I felt like I needed to use a healing potion and it was 5 hours before I died for the first time. I don't know what to make of it so it goes here.

[h2] Conclusion: [/h2]
If you're a fan of previous Dragon Age games, I don't feel like this game is for you. In fact I'm really not sure who it's for and I struggle giving it a recommendation. Many people seem to like it but my friends who are Dragon Age fans share many of my opinions. I played BG3 for 20 hours straight on release without realising, I was having so much fun. I remember going to bed and I couldn't wit to wake up and play it again. I managed to play 11+ hours in The Veilguard, and I went to bed disappointed and today I don't feel like playing it right now. I usually wait until completion before I write my reviews but I couldn't with this one. I will try again later and If I change my mind about the game down the line, I'll change my review, but as it stands, I do not recommend Dragon Age: The Veilguard"
Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178322836,"[h2] Dragon Age: The Veilguard [/h2]

The problem with Dragon Age: The Veilguard as a game isn’t about the presence or absence of any particular agenda. It’s not even about the shift away from the dark fantasy tone of the first game, as the BioWare director pointed out, saying that fans of the first game are no longer the primary audience, and therefore their voices don’t really matter much (even though early reviews by journalists mentioned a “return of BioWare,” and the developers themselves said they wanted to go back to their roots and regain fans’ trust).

How they plan to achieve that while doing the exact opposite of what fans ask for is a mystery to me. The game has a lot of flaws: boring characters, spoiling the main Dragon Age: Inquisition twist within the first 40 minutes (which was one of the main reasons I preordered the game, even though I had low expectations for its quality - at least the plot was intriguing). Overall, the game has become almost childish, as if it’s now rated PEGI 12.

The characters are completely uninteresting and lack any depth. The dialogue is just terrible, and as an RPG, it plays poorly. If it weren’t part of this franchise, I’d say it’s below average.

I also want to point out the discrepancy between the user score and the metascore on Metacritic (critics rate the game highly while players are, as usual, angry). Furthermore, for me, the mostly positive reviews on Steam are also surprising. I read positive reviews, and they literally say the game is average or below average, yet they give it a thumbs up!

This installment feels like a cheap Marvel production to me. Despite the mixed reception of Inquisition and its own controversial aspects, next to Veilguard, it now seems like a masterpiece.

The optimization is worth noting, but most of the time, you’re running through narrow, corridor-like locations, and aside from the occasional reflections, the graphics don’t seem much better than they were ten years ago in the previous game.
The combat has become purely action-oriented, without any turn-based elements, which is a matter of taste, though overall the combat feels energetic. However, the enemy design (including the darkspawn) now looks downright cartoonish and cringeworthy.

I’m someone who, in my own way, enjoyed both the second and third games and love the first one, but I consider this one not just the weakest but an outright mistake. The game lacks soul, it’s not engaging, and it feels like Starfield but in a fantasy world (bland and gray, despite its bright colors in design)."
Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178473482,"I haven't finished it. I played through 70% (and being very thorough with the side content) and can't anymore. The writing is terrible, the companions talk like villagers in Stardew Valley or similar casual sims (cutesy conversations about nothing), the writers are killing the lore built over previous three Dragon Age games, there is no atmosphere, sense of urgency, immersion. If you felt truly invested in characters or stories from previous DA games, this game will actively invalidate your previous choices and make your stories meaningless. 

I do not recommend this as a Dragon Age game. It is an OK generic action RPG, but as a part of the series, it is terrible."
Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178507831,"Beautiful graphics. Gameplay is a solid 10/10. Story is massively, cruelly disappointing. As someone who's beaten all three previous games several times each, I'm devastated to say I can't enjoy this one."
Dragon Age:The Veilguard,1845910,178119043,"It's not Dragon Age
As a game, it's decent.  
But the atmosphere of the previous games is gone. It's like playing Guardians of the Galaxy, which can be fun for some. 
But it's not Dragon Age. And that's what I personally wanted"
Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178782415,"Ok I'm having fun and there's a lot that's improved. 

Here's what's cooked: 

-Power sucks
-Menus in menus in menus. I still haven't found how to add workers to zones because I don't have the patience to sit in menu hell for any longer. 
-Navigation made with controller in mind. Stop trying to force PC players to deal with all the inefficiencies of a controller in a top-down management sim. You sold millions of copies of PC1 to PC players. This one is honestly the most annoying one. 
-The workshop sucks. Please give this up and go to steam workshop, Frontier. Ok I'm coming back to edit this. The workshop doesn't suck. It's abysmal. The load times are oppressive. PLEASE STOP THIS MADNESS FRONTIER. 
-Snapping feels...worse than PC1?
-Ride scenery ratings seem completely unaffected by...adding scenery to the ride or near the ride. 
-A lot of the QOL stuff that made PC1 so addicting is missing (hopefully just for now)

Besides the stuff above, I'm having a lotta fun. It's in a buy-state for hardcore Planet enthusiasts. But if the stuff above sounds like way too much for you to put up with, wait til they fix (...hopefully)"
Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178855866,"[h1]The current major flaws of Planet Coaster 2 (I still love it [/h1]
[b][u] The purpose of this review is to hope that future updates will truly listen to player feedback, restore those beloved core features, and optimize the experience to return Planet Coaster 2 to its original creativity and immersion. [/u] [/b]
[h2] Issue 1: Lack of Steam Workshop Integration [/h2]
Steam Workshop is one of the key features that makes this game stand out among simulation business games. The workshop feature of Planet Coaster 1 is very easy to use. However, the second generation abandoned Steam's workshop in favor of a self-built workshop system, which greatly reduced the experience. Network connections are often slow, resulting in a long time to load or download works. In addition, the process of subscribing to works is more complicated and not as convenient as the one-click subscription of Steam Workshop. What's even more unsatisfactory is that there are download restrictions on self-built workshops.
[h2] Issue 2: Misleading Multiplayer Mode [/h2]
The game was advertised as a multiplayer experience where players could collaborate to build their dream park. I even gifted a copy to a friend, looking forward to building a park together. Unfortunately, the reality is disappointing—""multiplayer mode"" simply means players take turns building, which doesn’t provide any real-time interaction and feels indistinguishable from single-player mode. [h3] To make matters worse, the developers have quietly removed the ""cross-platform multiplayer"" tag from the game without explanation. Rather than addressing why multiplayer functionality is lacking, the developers have simply avoided the issue, leaving players frustrated. [/h3]
[h2] Issue 3: Massive Content Reduction [/h2]
The original Planet Coaster offered a vast array of content with diverse themes and blueprints, making it easy for players to design varied and complex parks. In Planet Coaster 2, many classic themes like Fairytale, Western, and Pirate have been removed, leaving only limited Mythology and Viking themes. Without these beloved themes, players lack the range of scenery pieces they once had, and the number of available blueprints has been drastically cut. For players with limited time or design skills, these blueprints are essential for streamlining the building process. [h3]Unfortunately, the reduced content seems to pave the way for additional paid DLC, which feels like an attempt to ""nickel and dime"" the community.[/h3] The range of vegetation has also been significantly cut down to just four or five types of biomes, omitting classic desert or polar vegetation, which were previously included for free.
[h2] Issue 4: Restrictions in Sandbox Mode [/h2]
[h3] Career Parks Can’t Be Played in Sandbox Mode: [/h3]
[h3] Reduced Sandbox Map Size: [/h3] The sandbox maps in Planet Coaster 2 are noticeably smaller, about one-third the size of those in the original game. 
[h2] Issue 5: Missing Edge Scrolling Function [/h2]
In Planet Coaster, players could move around the map easily using edge scrolling, a simple yet highly convenient feature. However, this basic functionality has been removed in Planet Coaster 2, forcing players to rely on less efficient methods to adjust their view, which complicates navigation and diminishes the overall experience.
[h2] Issue 6: Inadequate Guest AI [/h2]
There are obvious problems with the path selection of tourists. They are still likely to concentrate in the same area, resulting in frequent congestion. Such problems not only affect the operating efficiency of the amusement park, but also cause tourists to be unable to enjoy the facilities in the congestion, such as being unable to find a restaurant or go to the toilet, which in turn causes various adverse reactions (such as vomiting). Even more disappointing is that the personality and type of tourists have also been cancelled, and the behavior of tourists appears to be monotonous and boring, lacking personalized interaction, affecting the sense of immersion.
[h2] Issue 7: Complex and Unintuitive UI Design [/h2]
The UI in Planet Coaster 2 is cluttered and unintuitive. Additionally, accessing submenus requires repeated clicks to locate specific items, and exiting these menus can also be cumbersome. While UI design should prioritize simplicity and ease of use, Planet Coaster 2 fails to meet these standards, resulting in a clunky user experience.
[h2] Issue 8: Missing Custom Audio, Video, and Image Import Features [/h2]
In Planet Coaster 1, players could import audio, video, and images from their computers, adding a personal touch to their parks. However, Planet Coaster 2 lacks this basic functionality, restricting players’ ability to personalize their parks and reducing the overall creative freedom.
[h2] Issue 9: Tedious Power and Water Repair Mechanic [/h2]
The most frustrating thing was that even if multiple technicians were hired, a generator could not be repaired quickly. Repeatedly clicking on the repair operation not only wasted time, but also affected the experience. If these events could be integrated into the plot or added more fun, they might be more popular with players.
[h2] Issue 10: Unrealistic Water Physics in the Waterpark [/h2]
Although Planet Coaster 2 emphasizes its waterpark theme, the water physics fail to deliver a realistic experience. For instance, the water behaves identically whether one or many people use the slides, ignoring the realistic differences in water reaction between light and heavy users. This uniform animation feels outdated and unconvincing, especially for a modern game.
[h2] Issue 11: Issues with Coaster Building [/h2]
The coaster-building experience in Planet Coaster 2 is less refined than in the original game, with several minor but frustrating issues. 
[h2] Issue 12: Weak Tutorial Experience [/h2]
[b]Planet Zoo I still remember how Nancy, a keeper, helped me from a novice to a qualified zoo manager. This process can be said to be very interesting. [/b]However, the tutorial of the second generation of RollerCoaster is boring and the prologue content is unattractive. 
[h2] Issue 13: Ineffective Weather System [/h2]
The weather system in Planet Coaster 2 is purely visual, with no meaningful impact on gameplay. Guests continue eating ice cream in the rain without umbrellas, which feels unrealistic. The game would benefit from more interactive weather effects, such as guests reacting to rain or seeking shelter. For a 2024 game, these interactions should be achievable, and their absence diminishes the sense of realism.
[h2] Issue 14: Difficult Staff Zoning with Persistent Bugs [/h2]
The employee zoning is very cumbersome and requires repeated adjustments during operation. However, even after the zoning is completed, employees are still not active in their work. Even if the task is nearby, employees will complain that there is nothing to do. This design is frustrating. In addition, the employee work area division system is not as convenient as the design of Planet Zoo. Even if the zoning is carefully set, employees still find it difficult to cooperate, which affects the management effect of the amusement park.
[h2] Issue 15: Reduced Management Content [/h2]
Many core management items have been removed in Planet Coaster 2, including vending machines, popcorn stands, hotels, restaurants, advertising boards, ATMs, security systems, and CCTV. These elements were key to the park management experience in previous games. Their removal leaves the park feeling incomplete and leads players to question whether these essential items will return as paid DLC. Even small features like customizing drink ingredients (e.g., adding ice) are missing, and fireworks have been completely omitted.

[h3] Planet Coaster 2 not only fails to build on the original but also takes significant steps backward by removing key content and limiting the management features that were once integral to the series. [/h3]"
Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178564004,"Absolutely incredible sequel to an already fantastic game series. It looks gorgeous the new quality of life features make creating theme parks a breeze. The new themes look amazing, coasters are smoother than ever and EVERYTHING in your parks is customisable. Some day-one performance issues and a janky UI shouldn't stop you from experiencing this truly joyful toybox of a game.

[hr][/hr]

[h1]Game Changers[/h1]
[u]Water Parks[/u]
The pools in PlanCo2 could be an entire game in themselves but here they are fully integrated into the theme park experience. Build a dedicated water park with highly themed plummets of doom or add a relaxing lazy river to your theme parks for guests to chill in before their next coaster, the choice is yours. 

Would love to see guests using the inflatables more often and hope to see side activities like and hot tubs and splash pads in the future.

[u]Scaling[/u]
I cannot understate how much of a game changer the scaling tool is. I have used it in every build I have done so far. Every non-grid piece, including foliage, is now scaleable allowing you to easily create huge variety just using a single piece, just hit the C key and resize away. Most items can go between half and double their default size so you can use a giant inflatable to welcome guests into the park and then have smaller versions of that crab to keep guests company on their sun loungers. 

I gather items have size limits due to textures and models looking distorted if scaled too much, but I say give us an option in the menu to disable scaling constraints, I can live with a pixelated texture if it means I can create the crab gift shop of my dreams!

[u]Custom Themed Rides[/u]
Another feature I was blown away by was the ability to stick scenery pieces to any coaster car and any flat ride. In the original game the rides were highly themed and, while gorgeous, you couldn't really use the ""Afternoon Tea"" themed Teacups in your dragon's lair themed area of the park. Now though you can theme that ride however you like and the pieces will animate along with the ride seamlessly. Tools like mirroring and duplicating make theming a breeze and there are already

Currently you can't add scenery to tracked rides (trains, boats etc) so I'd like to see this added. 

[u]Moving Platforms[/u]
Something I have seen hardly anyone talking about is the addition of moving platform scenery pieces. These three pieces sitting quietly in your scenery tab give you the ability to turn any object into an animatronic... which is HUGE! There is a spinning, rising and side to side version of the platform all triggerable and all with different animation options. Stick your scenery pieces to the platforms and boom, you have an animated piece. Combine these with flat rides and coaster cars for some truly unique creations.

[h1]Under Construction[/h1]

[u]Paths[/u]
The new path system is revolutionary. Draw out huge plazas, place rides and shops directly onto the path, edit existing paths, all of these are great additions, I couldn't imagine going back to the old system from PlanCo1. I do think the path system could still do with some work though, there are some oversights/limitations that I'd love to see addressed:

- The Stamp tool isn't available for queues
- The brush doesn't always snap to existing paths 
- You can't change a path from staff to regular to natural, you have to delete and redo it (even though the natural paths are listed along with regular paths)

[u]The UI Sucks[/u]
All of the feedback about the UI being poor is warranted. The buttons sound great when you click them and the icons have all been redesigned and updated to fit the new graphical style, but the menus are a complete chore to click through.

- The Browser (main menu bar) is sometimes not visible, this should ALWAYS be visible and clickable across the bottom of the screen
- The pop out menus (pools, coasters etc) all require scrolling when there is plenty of room on the screen for the box to be bigger
- ""Construction Mode"" and ""Edit Mode"" for coasters and slides are separate for no reason at all
- Dropdown menus have been replaced with carousel menus (click left and right to switch between options but can only see one at a time), any option where you show less info to a user is worse in my book. Pools have 4 depths and I'm constantly clicking the wrong arrow and having to go around all the depths to find the one I want
- When holding C to scale, moving the mouse Up/Right is decrease size and Down/Left is increase size. Surely Up/Right are more associated with ""bigger"". The slider on the menu is configured to have Left be smaller and Right be bigger so it's not even consistent in game.
- When setting prices for items in shops every item opens in it's own separate screen
- You have to click confirm after you select a colour.
- You can't see the colour properly as the selected piece is highlighted blue.
- You have to click ""done"" twice to exit a scenery group (once to exit the item once to exit the group).
- You can't select a grid before you place a piece.
- If you copy a piece while inside a group, and exit the group, you loose the piece (in PC1 the piece would remain selected for you to place down)
- The multi select tool requires you to confirm a selection
- The multi select when in a scenery group doesn't support additive and subtractive selections but the tool outside of this does

[b]Despite the above though the game is so good that it's barely bothered me at all. The good outweighs the bad in every sense and I trust Frontier's track record in supporting their games.[/b]

[h1]Wishlist[/h1]
Just in case anyone from Frontier is reading...

[u]Parades[/u]
This game is begging for parades! The ability to add scenery to coasters, rides and platforms is the perfect recipe for a parade system. Imagine you place a track with a start and end point, the cars are just empty platforms you can theme up, and guests gather as the cars go by... boom parade achieved! Let us trigger the parade at certain times and add entertainers to the cars to wave at the guests and we can achieve our most Disneyish dreams.

[u]Photographs[/u]
The best part about exiting a ride is stopping at the photo booth and laughing at your terrified face as you went over the big drop. I would be delighted to see guests come off of rides and check out their on ride photos, I'm imagining a shop called ""Happy Snaps"" with an alligator mascot (think Gulpee with a camera), guests who have been on rides with photos enabled can stop at this shop and buy photo prints, keyrings and mugs as souvenirs. Throw in some roving photographer staff (the Diver character Sandy Reef already has a camera) and static photo spots (combined with character spots maybe?) and you've got some charming gameplay that also feeds into park management and income.

[u]Weather Effects[/u]
Having weather in the game is great, I love seeing guests open umbrellas (RCT2 vibes) and love that sunburn is something you have to watch out for. I think it would be great for the weather to impact rides, some coasters should close during rain/lightning or high wind speeds. Guests could prefer covered rides during rain. Having this as toggleable option is a must though as it could get annoying in Sandbox mode.

The End
(I was only going to write a short paragraph...)"
Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178568041,"Overall there is so much potential but you missed the mark big time. The coaster builder is amazing but everything else should be reconsidered. PC1 felt intuitive and clean but PC2 feels clunky and overly complicated. Why does selecting a coaster type have to take up the entire screen? Why did you remove all of the options for the mouse controls for desktop? What on earth is the point of the edit and construction mode? Why can't we see the testing results and keep constructing? Does the edit/construction menu have to be so huge yet still you have to flip through to do stuff? Why remove the ability to individually control friction on each coaster or change the train types? These are just a few examples. I think all anyone really wanted was PC1 but with MORE features and a better coaster builder/smooth ride experience. What we paid for is a gutted version of PC1 that is harder to navigate and looks outdated already. The sharp and crisp menus of PC1 that actually offered useful and enjoyable features, has been replaced with large and bubbly buttons that do half as much and take up twice the space. Again, the coaster builder is amazing and super impressive but focus should be put on the UI and not fixing what wasn't broken."
Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178513517,"Iv'e played a few hours of Planet Coaster 2 so far, but I have played many many hours of the first game. Ok, its day one. The game just came out. But so far, it feels a bit off. The UI is a total mess, selecting something as simple as colors is made tricky, and water slides are super weird. All the new coaster types are great, and the coaster builder is great! I just hope the kinks are ironed out with future updates. Not a bad start, but not exactly what I was hoping for. I do still recommend it for coaster lovers. It is still a good game, just needs some fixing!"
Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178639992,"EDIT 1: I'd like to add one negative I forgot to mention in my initial review! The pathfinding on the park guests is pretty awful. If you have scenery on your paths, chances are they won't make any attempt to avoid it. They also tend to crowd and walk in a straight line to whatever they're most interested in, rather than spreading out.

After watching nearly all of the official PC2 content ahead of release, it's safe to say I was extremely excited to try it out! Then, the game releases, and I see it has mixed reviews. Clunky UI, unreasonable guest cap, crashes, blurry visuals, etc. All of this had me extremely worried since PC1 is fantastic and this game adds everything I wanted from a sequel. However, I'm happy to say that while these critiques are valid and deserve to be discussed, my experience with the game so far has been amazing. I'll go over a few points and provide my pros, cons and wishes for each one!

Graphics: 

PC2 looks fantastic. Vibrant colors, nice global illumination and reflections, fantastic animations and effects, it's definitely an improvement over PC1. And they finally made lighting work properly inside of buildings so that you can have REAL dark rides which is fantastic, I can't wait to mess with that. I always felt that PC1 looked a little ""murky"" if that makes sense, but I don't get that from this game. I don't really have any cons or wishes as of yet graphics-wise. There is the complaint that visuals are blurry, but you can fix that by turning off motion blur and depth of field (which was patched in the latest hotfix by making the game turn these settings off by default for new players).

UI:

This is the big one. I thought it was going to be genuinely awful based on how people were describing it, but I personally had no major issues? I could see why the coaster select screen would be a pain though as it is a lot of buttons, and I would like a way to duplicate colors from other objects without the use of hex codes (or even better, create custom pallets). Aside from this, the UI does lag when you're loading in new tabs. However, other than that, my experience with it has been mostly smooth. I'm completely against dumbing-down a PC release for the sake of console parity which is why the UI isn't as good as it could've been, but I don't think it ruins the gameplay at all.

Building:

Probably my favorite part of the sequel! I would always get OCD with PC1 when trying to perfectly center a gridless piece, but the new snap distance feature really helps remedy that. It's still not absolutely perfect, I did find myself having to use some weird techniques at some point like I would in PC1, but it's an extremely useful tool overall. And then you have the ability to attach scenery pieces to coasters and rides which is an absolute game changer. So many new creative possibilities when paired with the equally amazing scaling tool as well as improved color control and patterns. Another major complaint was the lack of the PC1 themes. I can see why people miss them but... isn't the point of a sequel to provide new stuff on top of the base mechanics of the original? All of the new themes are fantastic, and I wouldn't be surprised if they brought some of the old PC1 themes back in the future.

Pools/Flumes:

I'm so happy they brought these back from RCT3. When I first got PC1 I was actually extremely disappointed that it didn't have them (at the time I didn't read much into games before buying them so it was a surprise to me). I haven't gotten to mess with the flumes yet so I can't speak on the physics issues, it's nice to know that Frontier is working on fixing them though (not that it's an excuse for releasing them in a poor state in the first place, there's too much of that in the gaming industry already). The pools, however, are great. I love how the water looks, building them is really satisfying, and there are plenty of depth options for variation. I've been playing on sandbox so I won't be speaking on the management aspect of them. I also haven't gotten to use the wave machine or lazy river features yet which I'm very excited about. I do wish there were more pool extras though, hopefully we see a lot more in the future.

Rollercoasters/Rides:

The rollercoaster building system is fantastic as usual. Now, there are even more pieces to mess with such as drop and switch tracks. I don't have much to say about it, but I do love what's been added. Rides as well, customization is fantastic and there are plenty of great ones already in the game.

Management:

I mentioned previously that I've been playing in sandbox so I haven't really experienced the management. If I mess around with it at any point I might update my review!

Path System:

It's everything. Takes some learning, but once you know what you're doing with it, the possibilities are endless. I agree with the complaint that there needs to be stamps for queue paths, though. My plazas have never looked crispier than they have with these tools. Pools use the same system as well so there's a plethora of creative opportunities.

Extras:

Hate day one DLC. An extra $24.79 (CAD,) for 10 rides? Players who are unable to get the deluxe edition or upgrade to the DLC will feel left out even though it's not a massive amount of content. If they wanted extra money to (presumably,) support the promotional campaign ahead of the game's release, maybe they could've done a special physical edition, but locking 10 rides behind an overpriced DLC is disappointing to see from Frontier. The guest cap is definitely ridiculous, that literally could've just been made a setting, but it is going to be fixed soon which is nice. Hopefully this serves as a lesson to Frontier that PC and console should stay completely separate instead of being molten together to suit parity. The same goes for the Frontier workshop. I'm not too picky on the GB limit, but the Steam workshop should've at least been an option as well. People are used to it and like it. Aside from these bigger issues, I did have one crash randomly while building (I think I had been playing for about 14 hours at the time), but the autosave was automatically set to 3 minutes so I didn't lose much.

Final Thoughts:

Overall, I'm absolutely loving Planet Coaster 2. I think it's a massive improvement over the first game in nearly every way. While the critiques are valid, I don't personally think that any of them ruin the gameplay and Frontier is already working on fixes for most of them. Do I think the game deserves a mixed rating? Kind of. I think it would've been better off with a mostly positive. On one hand, it sends a message to Frontier that these are issues which need to be fixed. On the other hand, it may turn off a lot of players who wouldn't otherwise be bothered by some of these issues. I hope that the reviews go up once the game is updated a bit more as I genuinely think it's worthy of the time of anyone who enjoyed the original. I'd give PC2 a 9/10, it has an incredibly strong base that could be close to perfection with a little polish! Give the game a go if you've been waiting for it, I'm having an amazing time."
Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178568109,"This is tough for me to write. I LOVED Planet Coaster, I know it was not the perfect game but the foundation they had was incredible. For this to be the sequel I feel somewhat let down, Frontier have released an unfinished game.

- The UI is horrendous to work with, this game has been built for consoles.
- 6,000 guest cap? Again, this has been implemented for consoles, why have the not put a simple check box for unlimited?
- No night
- No hotels
- No security

From a foundation point of view, the game has gone backwards from it's predecessor.

I am hoping to change this review in the near future but currently, I am unimpressed.
"
Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178510360,"Wanted to love it, but can't. There are significant improvements and new features from Planet Coaster 1. But there are significant oversights, issues, and omissions too.

Waterslide physics are tragic. Riders and tubes go over hills at any speed like they have rollercoaster upstops. 'Open' special features like bowls, halfpipes, and such have invisible tracks for tubes to follow. Tubes suddenly come to a complete stop and make a 90 degree turn because that's what the invisible walls make them do. Tubes get stuck on an open halfpipe because they didn't get high enough to follow the hidden track to make it to the exit of the section. Tubes smack off edges of curved slide walls several feet before touching them. Sliders snap suddenly to a preset height on corners whether they're going slow or fast. Every rider and tube go down in an exactly identical way. 

Repeated textures are terrible. Every 10m of grass has the exact same pattern. Coloured patches repeat dozens of times across a single face of a rock. Every fifth tile on the path has the exact same dark spot.

Can't currently recommend, suggest you get it later when it's on sale or they've fixed some of the issues. Please Frontier fix the water slides. At least make them as good as the ones in Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, a game that's now 20 years old.



- Editied at 5.5 hrs playtime -

Even worse, discovered that on several special slide segments, rafts and tubes clip way through the walls of the slides. It is almost hilariously bad, that they locked rafts and tubes down to forced to following a hidden path, and didn't even check if that path clipped them through the slide. The raft is particularly bad, in some segments clipping the whole outer inflatable tube and three of the riders through the wall. This is noticeably visible from the outside of the slide. While in operation, you'll see every passing tube poke out of the slide for a good couple seconds."
Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178516120,"First of all, I must admit that the game looks better than PC1 The graphics and the lighting are incredible. The game have some good new features (pathing system, energy / water system, water parks) that makes it interesting for the people who never played PC1.

For the fans of PC1, it looks like the game is not finished (it lacks some BASIC features / object / facilities).  
The UI is just HORRIBLE and just counter-intuitive (way too many clicks). 
The game was clearly designed for consoles (anyone who are denying it are clearly lying to themselves as it is that obvious, it's as plain as the nose on your face)

The Frontier Workshop looks horrible and it is limited. The Steam Workshop was very good

To sum up : It is disappointing for PC1 players (on computers) because we made the success of PC1 and we are treated badly by Frontier. This version should have been the ""Beta testing version"" 6 months prior to the launch so they can correct what was wrong and have our feedback. Remember, players were really involved in the process of making PC1 (Alpha testing and Beta testing). For PC2, the players were left out of the process.

The game is more than just a DLC that could have been for PC1 but in the same time it's not a complete new version of the game either. 

I still have faith in Frontier because they proved in the past that they can listen to the players but we will have to wait at least  6-12 months to have a proper Planet Coaster 2. (And In my opinion to reach that goal, they should separate the console version and the PC version)

For the moment, it is a Not Recommended for PC1 fans but Recommended for newbies."
Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178507264,The interface was clearly designed with a controller in mind and is not intuitive to use with a keyboard and mouse. Everything takes way more clicks/key presses than it did in the original.
Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178785314,"I'm gonestly kinda confused.

The game is great by itself. HOWEVER: In comparison with the first part of this series, it lacks so many fundamental elements.  Why do I have to buy a 20€ DLC for example to get my old favorite wooden coaster? Why was it part of the base game in PC1? Weird. I don't want to spend 20€ extra on things I already had in PC1. 

Also, the workshop is slow. And by slow, I mean very slow. I have to wait 5-10mins until I get it loaded."
Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178510178,"Game runs great and is fun. Much like the first game.
If you like the first game, you will for sure like this one.
Only complaint i have is that you can't turn off rain in sandbox. But i'm sure they will fix that in the future."
Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178517115,"'Co-op' is just save sharing, you can't actually play together. Absolute let down and labelling it as multiplayer is a scam tactic."
Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178577706,"game seems to look and play well, somewhat amazing for a 1st day release game. 
That being said i am giving the game a thumbs down because of releasing DLC on the same day as the game for aprox. 1/2 the price of the main game. if the DLC is available on the day of the main game release it should be included in the game. just a cash grab. since the DLC DOES have to do with the actual game play (new rides as opposed to just cosmetic items) it is clear the developers are using as a cash grab. I will refund game and buy when it is on sale...paying for DLC that should have been included is just crap."
Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178660074,"Planet Coaster can be used to make a lot of different kinds of parks, and it facilitates many different styles of play,  So I can't say everyone will have the same experience as me, but I'm really enjoying this game.

At first I was super annoyed at the pathing tools, and the fact my rides were always breaking down even though i had a ton of idle mechanics.  But once i figured out that I could make hybrid spline+grid based paths that merged cleanly by using a combination of the path stamping tool and splines with the straight and curved  settings I was really happy.  Paths can still be fiddly but I also feel like I have more control over the layout now.  And making switchbacked queue pathing is a dream.

It still feels like mechanics do a really bad job of finding work on their own, but I mostly solved that issue by creating work zones, assigning mechanics to a zone and changing their schedule to work that zone all day.  I think a lot of negative feeling on this subject is that the condition system seems to work differently from PC1.  In PC1 breakdowns were a roll of the dice, with higher probabilities if the condition was low.  But in PC2 it appears breadowns only occur once the condition reaches zero and mechanics just need to service the ride before the service timer expires (which seems to be around a 1 or 2 hour game-time interval) to prevent the condition from decreasing.

One issue that I still have is that guests tend to walk to rides they want to go on then turn around and leave for seemingly no reason.  After some fiddling I discovered that the ride price was too high (despite setting the price to 'bargain').  Folks were walking up, deciding it was too expensive and leaving.  But there was no feedback, no thought bubble saying 'ride x is too much money' or the like.  So the system may be working as intended, but the feedback to the player could use a pass.

I've seen some funny stuff as well.  After several hours of downpour all my guests were heading to the gates.  On a whim I slapped down a Body Dryer and literally every single guest was drawn to that one point in the park in order to get dry.  Was also amusing to see all the trash they dropped in that one corner of the park.

On the visuals front this game is GORGEOUS.  The light filtering through the tree branches is really nice, and adding lights to your coasters at night is something to behold.  I'm running in 4k on a 4070Ti with max settings and DLSS balanced.  Not quite hitting solid 60 but likely close.  I'd kill for VR support, even if it was only for walking around the park and riding the rides.

Lastly, one other reviewer stated there was no random rotation of objects.  This is not true.  Not only is there random rotation but random scaling (and more!)  the trick is that you just need to make a scenery brush, add some scenery to the brush, enable the random rotation settings and set the min/max scale and now you can paint with trees.  I spent a good 30 minutes dialing in the perfect Black Spruce forest brush and now my viking village is looking fantastic.  Hundreds if not thousands of trees placed with no more than a click and drag.  Honestly, the new scenery brush is fantastic (its the small tree button in the lower right corner if you missed it).

Anyway, I'm having a great time with PC2.  Its got a few rough edges right now for sure, but I suspect they'll be knocked off with a few patches and hotfixes."
Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178608231,"After 10 hours of playing Planet Coaster 2, I have a lot of questions and disappointments. There are so many features missing that I loved from Planet Zoo and the original Planet Coaster. It’s surprising that with all the technology and features they already had, they didn’t use them here.

Currently, there are quite a few bugs that make the experience frustrating. The new path system behaves unpredictably and is difficult to make look clean and organized. Even the waterparks from RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 feel superior to what’s offered here; there’s practically no physics applied to water slides, which is really disappointing. Also, there’s no option for random rotation when placing items like rocks and trees, making landscaping feel repetitive.

Overall, I’d recommend waiting before purchasing Planet Coaster 2 and checking back once they’ve addressed these issues with updates."
Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178703404,"I do not recommend the game in its current state. There are many issues such as guests being stuck, not queuing properly or not visiting certain areas of a pool. It feels like the game has not been properly tested before release. Hopefully these issues will be addressed in the next couple of weeks.

I'm happy to see many features that were present in Planet Zoo, and there are some new cool features such as scenery scaling, scenery distance snapping and the scenery brush.

One major feature that I'm really missing is proper multiplayer. This was shortly advertised, but other COOP than sharing a save file is not present.'

Positives:
- Scenery scaling and distance snapping
- Scenery brush
- More pathing tools
- Lighting
- Moving platforms are nice to have
- Switch tracks and turntables enable layouts that were impossible in PC1
- Pools and slides are a nice addition, but need more work to be enjoyable

Negatives:
- Steam workshop is far superior and should be available for PC players
- Frontier workshop is very limited and requires a Frontier account to work
- UI/UX does not work well for mouse and keyboard (for example selector tool)
- Terrain stamps (like in Planet Zoo) are missing
- Water has no physics; the flumes/slides are just a preset smooth animation as if there are rails
- Guests in the water are all moving with the same animation which looks really out of place
- Pools are boring and need more content
- Guest path finding is very basic. They will go through any objects placed on paths and pools. A better approach would have been to use the animal pathfinding system from Planet Zoo.
- Barriers and kerbs don't block guest path finding
- Research tree is a nice concept, but the content is too basic. More stuff should be locked behind research.
- Why is the minimal path width still 4m? With the new tools we can draw much smaller paths, but placing them via the other tools would be much better.
- No custom music or billboards on launch (should be added soon?)

Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178591027,"I'm playing on an extremely mid rig with min spec GPU set on High graphics values in-game and I've had zero issues at 5700 guests/30+ rides. None of the lag and skippiness of PC1, no lapse when adding coasters.  I have had exactly one crash while editing my first transport ride... and they're already releasing a hotfix to address that issue already.

I'm a bit miffed that the UI is just is clunky as PC1, absolutely no streamlining whatsoever? What??

Anyway, I 95% recommend this game. 

 Thanks, Frontier! We granny gamers love a good coaster game!"
Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178540488,"DLC bait, Planet Coaster 1 content not present at all, if this is your first Frontier experience go ahead and have fun if you want, but for PC1 habitual players this is just limiting yourself in every way but pathing, and also an utter joke when it comes to future expansions adding content already released and paid but with better shaders and textures and an extra bush for 15$ each, in my opnion Planet Coaster 1 is still the best option (also for newcomers) by far.
No western, no adventure theme, no snowy/winter theme, no studios/city theme, almost zero animatronics, no hotels, water slides are a joke in every way but their stetic and they were a big selling point for this game, damn Frontier, are you guys taking the sims route? this feels like a big Planet coaster 1 DLC with better graphics but without Planet coaster 1 content at all, do you realize that Planet Coaster 1 offers a way better and cheaper experience right now? You make people refund and wait 2 plus years for the complete and cheaper experience in a complete pack and in this case it shouldn't be excusable, you are not a rookie anymore, also the multiplayer lie was sketchy af, I'll give it a chance in a few years, hope you are proud of yourselves, no one was pressuring you, you had time and resoures, not recommended in my honest opinion."
Planet Coaster 2,2688950,178515416,The store page says multiplayer but you cannot have more than one person play at a time. They should not be allowed to call it multiplayer.

The Evil Within,268050,177004465,"A masterful take on the Resident Evil 4 formula directed by the master of the genre itself. Some may not like how scarce the ammunition can sometimes get and how the player character is cheaply thrown into seemingly hopeless situations to try to yank a reaction out of the player. I liked how the environments and threats were numerous, ever changing to keep the game feeling fresh from start to finish. The only adversary that I found irritating were the traps placed on the walls and floors, the bomb quick time event felt difficult to defuse for my slow boomer reflexes. Sometimes the scarcity of ammo makes progressing feel hopeless, but things seem to always turn out great if you keep on trucking. Shooting doesn't always feel as right as it did in RE4, as the enemies shrug off multiple headshots too easy and go for your throat. But if you liked this game's forefather, then stop reading this and start playing damn it."
The Evil Within,268050,178633300,"Meh,

The idea is great, but the more I play, the worse the game gets. It's very buggy, the animations and camera are really made for open spaces and ranged combat, the problem is that de devs decided to force you in tight spaces to make it ""more intense"". This causes the camera to shit itself and the animations to break. The auto save system is very clunky. The pc port is horrible, it was already outdated on release, and it's even worse now. Unlocking framerate is possible, but it will break even more stuff like the damage in grab animations. 

It just feels like a worse Resident Evil without any polish.

Would only recommend for players that can handle lots of bugs and outdated poorly designed mechanics."
The Evil Within,268050,178708147,"C'est en fait un Resident Evil 4.5 avec une surcouche psychologique un peu lourdingue. Mais comme c'est difficile de faire de la merde avec le gameplay de RE4, on a au final un jeu très plaisant malgré tout."

The Evil Within,268050,177680053,"Somehow... I managed to beat this game on console years ago. I remember liking the story a lot so I thought I'd pick it up on PC and replay it. However it's a lot harder than I remember. If you're not liberal with your game saves it's possible to get basically stuck because the resources are so few and far between. The game is very pretty, even nowadays, however the game play lags behind. 

I wouldn't recommend this. I would recommend maybe watching someone else play through it, you'll experience much less frustration."
The Evil Within,268050,177038430,"The Evil Within is a masterfully crafted survival horror game that pays homage to the genre's roots while introducing modern gameplay elements. With its engaging story, strategic gameplay, and terrifying atmosphere, it offers a truly immersive experience that will haunt players long after they’ve put down the controller. For horror enthusiasts or anyone looking to test their courage, The Evil Within is a must-play title that stands as a testament to the power of psychological horror in gaming. It’s a chilling journey through the darkest corners of the human mind, and one that is not to be missed.

Score: 9/10"
The Evil Within,268050,177913165,"I wish I could play this game for a full opinion, but it randomly decided to stop working on my Steam Deck. Just infinite loading in both Desktop and Game Mode.

However, what I was able to play wasn't particularly good, so I'm going to say it wasn't a huge loss.

"
The Evil Within,268050,177318564,"One challenge with horror games that let players fight back is that it can quickly diminish the fear factor of the games. If the player’s power is too strong (as seen in this game) and the story is not intriguing enough, the experience becomes tedious. I'm pretty sure that the developers noticed this; that's why they added harder modes with limited resources and invincible enemies to make it more 'challenging'. This seems to be a good solution because Resident Evil also did this. However, in Resident Evil, reducing resources means you need to either avoid fighting enemies or fight them with caution. The Evil Within, on the other hand, doesn't allow that. You are still forced to fight, but just with reduced resources, making it super pointless to play with those challenges except if you want to improve your skills."
The Evil Within,268050,177871779,this is honestly one of the most unplayable games ive ever played. the stealth fucking sucks because they tried to make it theatrical lines on the top and bottom of the screen which means you cant see anything.

This game doesnt stand up to RE5, let alone RE4, with a story and characters more boring than either."
The Evil Within,268050,178636132,"Just dropping, S Tier Horror Survival that still holds after 10 years, what an amazing game. 

This game will always stay close to my heart, the last I played it was probably 8 years ago and it has been lying in my steam profile for ages but I never bothered to play it, After finishing The Evil Within 2 I was in hopes of The Evil Within 3 but that never happened and never will happen (Thank you Microsoft). 

With all the horror survival buzz thanks to Silent Hill 2 I didn't want to get that game at the moment but really felt like diving back into this one and man what a fantastic game.

I think this game got a bad rep when it released because of poor optimization and that really dragged it when it came to its performance on console and PC's back in the day but now it runs flawlessly even at higher fps and that just makes it way more fun. 

True horror survival, although linear, it's difficult, rewarding and A LOT of fun, MUST recommend, this is coming from someone who owns and has played ALL of the Resident Evil games. 

Thank you Shinji Mikami, you truly are the father of horror survival games, your formula has made so many studios successful in the last 10 years, even when you were not working on the Resident Evil games anymore you gave them the template from Resident Evil 4 and the remake has been huge, I know there were others who made the game too and their efforts are appreciated."
The Evil Within,268050,177142693,"What's scary about this game? Wasting your money, that's what. I don't normally write a review before I beat a game. That being said...I will be fair with this game. When I first started playing it, there were a couple of concept scares. At the beginning a guy chases you around with a chainsaw, and you have to sneak by him. Those are the kind of scare gimmicks you can expect. The game itself isn't scary. Once you're over those, it's just frustrating. I'm on Chapter 10 and I wish it would just end. It's not because the game is dated. It's because the writing was bad. I get it, I'm reliving all these memories from some guy named Ruvik who suffered childhood trauma...I'm only playing through it to end the story...Look, I love survival horror games. This game was clearly trying to be Resident Evil 4, with absolutely no ammo. The whole, low ammo aspect that is supposed to make the player anxious, just pisses me off. I have to make every single god damned shot count. In actual survival horror games you can save up your ammo, run away, etc. In this game, you get 4 shots with your pistol...and you HAVE to kill the enemy. It's easier to shoot an object in real life than it is in this game. Seriously, go to a shooting range. You can level up your melee, but even at level 4, it does hardly any damage. I wish I never fucking started this game. Big thumbs down."
The Evil Within,268050,178210507,"I first played this years ago and loved it, I came back to it recently and still love it. I recommend this game for those who love scary games but don't want to be overly scared."
The Evil Within,268050,178269565,"First of all, many technical issues with this game.  Was kind of a shoddy port in general back in the day with terrible narrow fov, letter boxing, in a third person perspective.  Fortunately most are fixable with a bunch of mods and start up parameters but this should not be the case ten years after release.

As for the game itself, pacing is poor.  Design is poor.  I don't think they knew what they wanted this to be.  Beginning just a lot of random mechanics but it starts to get a bit better after chapter 4 or so.  Some really neat level transitions and art design.  Unfortunately some really cheap bosses that are bad puzzles bosses which one hit kill you.  Later on they decided it should be an action game with poor design decisions and balance issues.

I will probably eventually beat this as I got through a decent amount of the game.  I couldn't get myself to play it multiple times back in the day because of the poor beginning and poor port and it's a shame it's still kind of a mess."
The Evil Within,268050,177495667,Gore gore gore. So much it's ridiculous. The controls are terrible on keyboard. Lighting equally terrible. Each area is more annoying than scary. This game wishes it could be Outlast.
The Evil Within,268050,177627257,"This game is a roller-coaster of good and horrible design. Hated first chapter, loved the second. I didn't start to hate the entire game until chapter 9. At that point, the flaws became more clear. The game would rather be a movie than a game. The game does not enforce its rules consistently. The game promises one thing, and then breaks it when it feels like it. It's all the worst aspects of the hated Resident Evils, ""but at least it looks scary!!!""

I hear the sequel is actually good, but this one is definitely not.
I personally don't recommend you waste your time on this game. But if you've run out of other horror games, maybe you can find some value in this."
Lost Ark,1599340,177590818,"Lost ark is a very fun game when you get down to the core game play, mechanics, and the actual content. The raids are phenomenal. The music is outstanding, and the content of the game is extremely fun.

HOWEVER: The developers of the game do not punish people who exploit the game left and right. It's a constant struggle for power. Everything is gatekept, and if you do not play all the time, you will fall behind. It's not something you can play casually. People constantly RMT, and the community is probably more toxic than WoW or even League of Legends. It's just not worth it. I have 1200 hours in the game, and I tried returning, I'm just too far behind. It's not worth it. Even with the ignite servers now, there are just too many issues."
Lost Ark,1599340,177466948,"Recently an exploit was found that allows for essentially infinite resources, materials, and other essential items for leveling up your characters. This has been exploited immensely by portion of the player base. This impacts the in game market and ability to get into content, as well as providing a substantial tangible disadvantage for how much damage your character does for non-exploitative players.  Currently no action against said cheaters has been taken.

I'm leaving this review up until there is substantial punitive action taken against the players. If AGS and Smilegate cannot show that there are consequences for cheating. There is no reason to play this game."
Lost Ark,1599340,177220598,"This game's reputation is, unfortunately, a stain that no review will be able to wash away. Yes, you've heard right - you can spend endlessly in pursuit of power. Grouping is difficult, because power is the prerequisite for acceptance by other players. The game's raids are brutally difficult, further exacerbating the need for power.

That's only part of the story, though. Lost Ark is a brilliant game with the most engaging combat and character progression that I've ever experienced in an MMORPG. It is brutal, unforgiving, yet highly rewarding once you've mastered its systems. I cannot recommend it enough."
Lost Ark,1599340,178558592,"tl;dr: AGS as a publisher and the KR MMORPG grindy game doesn't respect your time. Play something else.

Lost Ark's best part is the challenging but fun raids. Some of them do requires you to respect patterns and adjust your movements + skill rotations around them.
Everything of the game is pretty much fubar. If you don't have decent active guild with players that played latest raids, you can find yourself in lobby waiting room simulation from time to time. Horizontal progressions take bloody amount of time.
Classic KR mmorpg have super grindy progressions that waste your time such as Elixirs/Transcendence clicking. Even with AI/calculators, it can still takes up hours to do them, with pure RNG.

3 weeks ago I got a temp ban because I exploited a simple Stronghold visiting trick that AGS/SG should've disabled easily in the first place. 1 month of temp ban would already put me behind the raiding curve for months. This is because I mainly played 1 character (my highest char is ilvl 1660), second highest at 1640, rest alts at 1620.
On 5th November, AGS found out their scripts didn't remove items properly on 2 weeks banned players that exploited the bug. Many of original 1 month banned players like me extended into perma-bans. REMINDER that AGS could've done rollbacks instead of this roundabout temp bans. 

The 7 sets of boxes I opened temporarily didn't even worth much, I used most of them on quality tapping. I told customer support to reconsider my perma-ban duration. But instead I received an automated bot message at 10:57 am after I typed up my appeal. (Basically no real life person actually looked into my appeal at all).

Founder buyer with 8.6k playtime, never chaos dungeon botted, never RMT'ed, never bussed in raids. First offence (the actual proper temp ban already punished me enough) but AGS's own incompetence with their crappy scripts can supercede their own ban approach is super disgusting."
Lost Ark,1599340,176998910,"The game felt actually fun in the beginning during Valtan-Akkan days. There were definitely issues despite this though, but it was way more bearable then the current state of Lost Ark. Lost Ark right now has some of the worst systems in mmos that I have ever experienced. Elixirs and Transcendence hold back the game to such a large degree, that it suck outs the fun, making me feel like not even wasting my time to play. These terrible progression systems on top of the awful gatekeeping that is present within the game really just makes the game feel like such a massive waste of time despite the combat being super enjoyable. 

I really do strongly believe that Ignite servers are a step in the right direction compared to most of these progression events that have been around for awhile. Ignite servers feel like how the game should be played for the Western version. However, despite this, the awful progression systems hold back this shining light of potential. They give a free 40 set of elixirs for playing on ignite servers, but the free 40 set is the luck set bonus (when you're dps you want critical or master set bonus, and for support you wants faith, luminary or advance). So you still need to cut at least your helmet and gloves, which isn't nearly as bad as current live servers starting from scratch, but it is still pretty bad because.. well the systems just suck so bad. Not only is it just awful rng but it is time consuming from actually playing the game. 

Honestly, solo raids are awesome, but it only goes up to ivory tower, and they nerfed the gold from Akkan solo recently (when it is bound gold which is absolutely harmless). I dunno why they continue to go down this path of speaking for mokokos (new players) and advertising for them, yet making the game super hostile to new & returning players. 

It's sad really because the game has potential, but the developers choose to make the game designed this way instead of fixing the problems in a timely manner. This won't be good for the health of the game. Have already seen the numbers plummet in terms of population."
Lost Ark,1599340,178431053,"In Itself a very nice game to play, sadly it is published by Amazon Game Studios (AGS). These guys continued to prove how incompetent they are since launch and it is getting worse with almost every new big patch. Recently we had an uncountable number of bugs and exploits, some of which haven't even been adressed at all (we're talking item and gold DUPLICATE bugs), with players getting bans extended for absolutely no reason or hardcore abusers getting a free pass. 

Great game ruined by horrendous management and communication problems left and right.

Save yourself the trouble of interacting with the nightmare that is AGS and stick to other games."
Lost Ark,1599340,177153541,Considering how they run games its a miracle server is not shut down yet. It is a P2W game but nothing on shop it worth to buy which forces wallet whales to just g2g happy life. They say they ban bots but they don't. They say they ban RMTs but I see number of g2g enjoyers already full T4 lvl 10 gem with full Relic engraving just happily RMTing. IF you ever see AMAZON GAMES on your game just delete it and save ur valuable time on something  actually matters
Lost Ark,1599340,177387148,Great Game. Horrible publishers. They are killing the game with their customer care and bad service. I wouldn't be surprised if this game is dead in a couple of months
Lost Ark,1599340,177988860,"Where to even start? Lost Ark is literally the perfect game. for those who love endless grinds, hollow gameplay, and developers who are allergic to any form of meaningful feedback.

The community first and foremost is a load of gatekeeping elitists that think themselves to be gods simply because they spent the last year grinding away at this hollow game. They'd rather trash new players than actually help them, and that is beyond pathetic. If you are looking for a friendly and helpful player base, keep looking, because Lost Ark's community makes Dark Souls players look like saints.

And what about the devs? They are living in an echo chamber. Either that, or they honestly don't care about players outside of their cash shop. Updates are either rushed and broken or late with zero communication. Balance patches? Haha, good luck! Half the classes feel like they were coded as an afterthought. The PvE content is monotonous, PvP is broken, and the only ""endgame"" here is spending real money to keep up with whales.

Honestly, Lost Ark feels like it was created by people who have never played a real RPG in their lives and is supported by the community who believes that suffering is ""content."" If you have any self-respect, stay far away from this mess."
Lost Ark,1599340,177710134,"If you are thinking about starting to play this game...just don't. It isn't worth the time and investment. The combat and raids are great, however the game so poorly managed by AGS and the communication from them is some of the worst I've ever seen."

Lost Ark,1599340,177524493,"One of the biggest exploits just happened in the game, and while ags dealt with the issues and started rolling out punishments for people who used the exploit, their fix also caused legit players unable to access their characters if they were in a certain area before the fix was implemented. Now, they are punishing legit players because of the exploiters as they are unable to log into their characters. Sent multiple support tickets to help unstuck my character and no response. They do not care about you. Do not play this game."
Lost Ark,1599340,177474287,"I have mixed feelings about Lost Ark, but I'll give it a try.

The good:

- it is a fun game with well made dungeons and bosses.
- badass villains and heroes and some well made cutscenes.
- a very well made soudntrack. Seriously, the Brelshaza's Phantom Alstagia boss song brings me a tear to my eyes everytime I listen to it.
- fluid and nice skill moves.
- a nice enough story. It's a cliche of good vs evil, but it's nice enough.
- a good amount of content to those aiming at collectibles.
- the skills of the characters are in general well made allowing nice combos and moves that generates the thrill of playing a Action RPG.
- the skins for characters are quite well made, and it's possible to farm those in game, without the need to put real money on the table.
- events in-game from time to time to level up a character, because leveling a character from scratch is a pain.

The bad:

- RNG on EVERY SINGLE PROGRESSION SYSTEM. Seriously, whoever design this has a serious gambling problem.
- a toxic player base that resembles a VX gas canister. *sigh* I mean it, they are like brats playing League of Legends and is one of the WORST aspects of this game.
- the game is made on Unreal Engine 3 and despite running well on most modern PCs, there's some tweaking with configs to achieve a good performance.
- game suffers from time to time from disconnects, mainly because of the anti-cheat system and the game takes ages to boot even on a SSD drive.
- on the topic about disconnects: got dced on the last minutes of a raid? Pray that you can log back in time, otherwise, the game will count it as ""complete"" but you don't get any reward. No Gold, no EXP, no Mats, no nothing. :(
- there are many other aspects that I found bad, but it'll make this review too long and there's plenty of those here on Steam already, so... yeah.

Conclusion:
As of OCT 21th 2024, it is a nice time to give it a try if you can withstand the bad aspects and it is F2P (for now), but after playing since launch and more than 4500 hours of gameplay, I cannot in my right mind recommend it to anyone as it is right now.
Unless you are looking for a full-time job kind of dedication, progressing in this game is about luck, perseverance, patience and to some, deep pockets to pay your way to the top."

On top of it all, the both the original developers as well as Amazon Game Studios mismanage the game to such an extreme extent in the west that it's laughable. Between game-breaking bugs, inconsistent ToS policy enforcement and backtracking, and insanely egregious systems set up to sink their claws into your wallet, this ""game"" is more an exercise in ultra aggressive monetization strategies masquerading as an initially enjoyable and novel experience with an amazing combat system."

Diablo IV,2344520,177216783,"I have been playing Diablo Games for nearly 30 years. I cannot recommend this game at full retail price.
Is Diablo 4 good? Yes, as a generic ARPG. Buy this game AND expansion ( if you can call it that) on sale at a discount.

Does Vessel of Hatred make it better? Marginally, by making the game feel like a clone of Diablo 3 (for better or worse.)

Rune words feel lazy. Mix any two stones and get their prefix and suffix. No unique builds akin to the D2 LOD system.

The Spirit born is just a D3 Monk with Druid vibes minus the auras and plays like the Blood Knight from Diablo Immortal. It wouldn't surprise me if it was a copy paste job done to save time. 

Paladins ARE put in game! JUST LIKE WE WANTED! As non playable, chumpy characters. It even seems like they fleshed out the skills for a Crusader / Paladin just to give them to a Mercenary.  

Lorath is on vacation, the whole game. Said to be looking for Nayrelle ends up meaning WHO THE HECK KNOWS, BUT HE LEFT YOU A LETTER!

The base world and story telling do not fit the theme of Diablo. Too much emphasis is put on friendship, trust and feel good moments. This is a direct contrast of the GRIM DARK feeling they were going fr in this game. All for the story itself to never be finished and told to completion. 
Even after the expansion, no new end game boss, no fighting prime evils. No conclusion!

The fact that Blizzard would sell us an unfinished Expansion for the price of a fully loaded base game is beyond me. 
This game should more accurately be titled INTRO TO the Vessel of Hatred seeing as there is no new end game boss, the story is lacks conclusion and feels like a seasonal update not an expansion DLC, and the new monsters are just reskins of existing enemies. Flayers are a rare enemy encounter and underutilized. 
The Real Money Store works great though and you can be rest assured there are plenty of 20 dollar skins for you to spend money on.
"
Diablo IV,2344520,176963136,"The gameplay loop is like this: you click everything that moves and vacuum up the loot, then click through Reddit posts to complain about RNG. You click through all the dialogues and cutscenes, because reading is for nerds, and you gotta keep clicking anyway. Occasionally, you click through YouTube for overpowered builds, usually constructed around exploiting a bug, of which there are many. You click through the store: even though you paid full price for the game, the expansion, and the season pass, you are wondering if you should spend the annual GDP of Belgium on a decent-looking armour set for your character. You keep clicking monsters, but for some reason, the game doesn't click for you. Might as well keep doing it:  it's too late to refund and buy Baldur's Gate 3 instead, and Path of Exile 2 isn't out anyway."
Diablo IV,2344520,177111270,"There is a cancer festering inside Blizzard and it needs to be cut out.

- Introduce expansion that f*cks everything up again
- Rinse and repeat...

This game is just one perpetual ALPHA!"
Diablo IV,2344520,177040901,"As a game, it's a positive experience overall. However, the Steam version of the game gets a negative rating from me for one simple reason. It's not a fully complete title for those who wish to play the game in its original language (English) with subtitles (without using dubbing in any language). The Steam version only offers a simple option: either you play entirely in English, or you play fully dubbed (in any of the languages supported in the game). You don't get the option to switch to a version with subtitles. This option is available, however, if you purchase the game through Battle.net.

So, if you're dreaming of playing without dubbing, buy the game through Battle.net.

For this reason, I rate the Steam version negatively, as this information is not disclosed anywhere on the platform, yet you still have to pay full price for what is essentially an incomplete product."
Diablo IV,2344520,178542749,"There is an unbelievable amount of disconnecting, rubber-banding, and game crashing. It's currently unplayable for me despite several troubleshooting attempts. It's just not fun not being able to play."
Diablo IV,2344520,177505040,"First, locking some of the coolest gear behind a $35.00 pay wall is despicable.  $35.00 CAD skins, unreal. It is what Mortal Kombat 1 does, and it is vomit inducing. Never would I pay that, it's only like 2 cool skins per class, but still.

Anyway, the game is fun for sure, it's more complex majorly over Diablo 3, but I haven't play 3 since 2021, and I only played about 50 hours. But yeah, open world Diablo? Bangin. It's challenging to get your gear up, optimising, learning the game, and trying to make your way to the hardest world tear. The story is well acted, that's underappreciated. Plus Mommy Lilith becomes more attractive every cut scene, something weird going on there. Lots of content, easy to get your money's worth. Addicting gameplay.

Diablo IV,2344520,177177325,"If you need a distraction in your life, this game is okay. But Blizzard has literally made better experiences of this formula in the past and it feels like going backwards.

Especially the expansion. I joined D4 really late in the original release, and now that the expansion pack is out, I made the dumb decision to not play Spiritborn. I am now just bashing my face against enemies in an endless boring loop.

The game crashes daily on me, and also has a lot of networking issues. The game has a really hard time communicating its ideas and giving the player information - combat text is obnoxious and you can't track down specific values to see if what you're doing is working. You are given potions that literally say ""Increases equipment drops"" that don't see to do anything.

I have been really disappointed in owning this game, in supporting this game, in wasting time in this game. There's a whole world of games out there vying for my attention which are much more worthy given their efforts to create a good experience; communities who care about the game play health, who are more careful about communicating their ideas and not just spilling the jankiest product.

Don't make my mistake. Move on. Its over."

If you're buying this game to play on the Steam Deck, DO NOT! You will be beyond disappointed when you are staring at the Downloads screen for ***DAYS*** at a time.

The game is fun, but after amassing some great equipment and feeling like my character was finally becoming powerful enough to face big monsters without dying, a new season begins and all of my equipment is utter trash.  My character is basically back to a level one trash character.  What was the point of spending all that time on trying to advance my character if you're just going to change everything and make my equipment worthless?  I stopped playing for about 2 months over the summer and hadn't really gotten far enough to realize how trashed my character was after the seasonal reset because I hadn't played in so long. However, this time around, my character was strong and I was playing regularly...and then Vessel of Hatred comes along and now Diablo 4 truly is earning MY HATRED.  I'm cutting my losses and never playing this trash again.  I hope all you idiots at Blizzard got the big money you were hoping for, because I'll never spend another dime on a Blizzard game ever again. 0 STARS. WOULD *NOT* RECOMMEND!"
Diablo IV,2344520,177179831,"The feel of the game is destroyed when you reach the first real town, planning on doing single player, and find dozens of rando players running around your map.

Oh, and the newest DLC costs the same as an ENTIRE GAME, at it's most basic rank. My fault for not doing more research, but I expected better after 3 great games. Crossing future Diablo/Blizzard games off my wishlist."

Diablo IV,2344520,177852479,"I wish I could like this game. I absolutely adored Diablo 1 when it came out and spent waaaay too much time after work playing it. D4 has all the right ingredients, excellent voice acting, lovely graphics, good environmental effects (wind, rain, ash, etc) interesting dungeons and ruins, but the endless fetch quests really soured me on the game. 

Everything is a fetch quest. Every little side quest is the same, ""go get this, or do this and I'll give you this."" It's boring and really sucks the fun out of the game. The main story is little better, always one step behind the main bad guy (or girl, in this specific case) or their minions, and only if you go explore this one new area, you might find them, otherwise...more fetch quests!

So, it's repetitive, and that's a negative for me. Also, some classes are stupidly overpowered. My main character is a Necromancer which I thought would be fun to play. I was wrong, One of the first skills you get is the ability to summon skeleton archers. At my current level as of this writing, 33, I have 4 archers and 3 with scythes, and I rarely have to interact with any of the enemies as the software detection is so good, my army is attacking the enemies before they even get on the screen for me to see them. So all I have to do is wander around and pick up loot and occasionally throw a spell at a boss-level bad guy. It's very dull, made worse by my skeleton army auto-respawning on the rare occasions that they are killed in action.

So, I'll probably keep at the game in small doses, but unless the game changes for the better down the road, I wouldn't suggest you play it unless you really like easy repetitive games."

Here is my problem... For once, Blizzard gave us an evil character we could side with in Lilith... And a story to boot. But gave us no ""free will."" Which is what Lilith was supposed to give us... And the Blizzard lazy @'s gave us none. Probably the best story in a Diablo series ever gave to us... And it is still linear. I wanted to side with Lilith from the begining . And it would have been a perfect set up for the PvP parts of the game... On one hand it is a great story... and on the other they screwed the pooch on letting us , the players , determine our ending... And of all the Diablo games... this was the story to let us determine our own path... instead the main character you play ... plays some hard ass without any doubt... If you ask me, We have beat down all the lords of hell , from Diablo 1 to 3 ... And so why would I not chose Lilith? If she wins ... Why couldn't I beat her down , just like her father Mephisto? So f'ing weak. 
     You are paying for a linear story, that is so lame and lazy ... it isn't worth your money... keep playing Diablo III.
      In the end, it plays no different than the prior 3 releases. Blizzard really had a chance to give us something,,, and they chose to give us the same old crap.

The inconsistent patch notes, this game has become Dragunov simulator, EVERY time you get to a promotion match they DC and they get 0 punishment for it. This is not the Tekken we deserve...its the Tekken we got...."
TEKKEN 8,1778820,176380005,"The game has potential, but the tekken team is too busy implementing greedy predatory monitization practices on a FULL PRICED game instead of focusing on content, balancing and netcode."
TEKKEN 8,1778820,175647565,"> constant 50/50 with every character
> dragunov and nina running the meta for 6 months straight
> heat mode get out of jail free card

yeah ive seen enough, nerf devil jin"
TEKKEN 8,1778820,176378296,Seriously? Paid for season pass & deluxe edition but both of the option does not include the stages? RM339 but does not include the season stages? Feeling like getting scammed here? (The game is fine but the monetisation is not)
TEKKEN 8,1778820,175362006,"Game's a 50/50 button masher by design. Players are 2 buttons away from dealing 80% of your life with Rage Art or Heat Smash. The Side-Step 3D element is ruined by half of the abilities homing. Blocking is a joke when you get slowed with negative frames or take massive chip damage. Everyone has an easy 50% damage launch combo that takes longer than a turn based RPG. Cheating is Rampant and unmanaged... I could go on and on.

If you are a button masher, or a self hating tryhard that is willing to study an impossible amount of frame data to tilt a 50/50 in your favor, you might enjoy this game. If you are sane and just want a simple game where you tussle and express skill, then I wouldn't call this a true fighting game."
TEKKEN 8,1778820,173335493,"Tekken 8, while undeniably more accessible than its predecessors, has stripped away much of the tactical depth that defined the series. The game feels like it's been simplified to cater to a larger player base, but at the cost of what made Tekken unique. What we're left with is a game that's largely about 50/50 situations, with little room for the nuanced, defensive play that even 2D fighting games manage to preserve.

One of the biggest disappointments for me is how defense is not only unrewarded but outright punished, particularly with the introduction of chip damage. In other fighting games, there are defensive tools to counterbalance aggressive play, but in Tekken 8, it feels like the game is designed to reward the player who can memorize the best combos and apply pressure non-stop. The Ranked matches exacerbate this issue, becoming a toxic experience where opponents either quit after one match, have unbearable lag, or exhibit other frustrating behaviors.

After over 100 hours of trying to give this game a chance, I've lost the drive to continue. I might revisit it if Kunimitsu is reintroduced, but for now, Tekken 8 is getting uninstalled. I'm finding more satisfaction in games like Guilty Gear Strive or Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising, where my efforts in practicing hit confirms are actually rewarded, unlike in Tekken 8, where any attempt at analysis seems to get me punished anyway.

The final straw for me is the Battle Pass system, which feels even more intrusive and unpleasant in Tekken 8 than in Rising. It's a feature I genuinely dislike and it only adds to my overall disappointment with the game."
TEKKEN 8,1778820,176321582,"best fighting game I've ever played, mk1 is hot garbage compared to it. sf6 was my first fighting game but I'm never going back after goin 3D"
TEKKEN 8,1778820,176243761,"Despite the quality and polish this game is not worth the money, because how egregious the monetization is. This game does NOT cost 70 dollar. It costs a lot more. DLC characters and stages matter even if you are not interested to play them. You cannot train against any character you don't own, you can't even use some replay functions. Stages have gameplay impact meaning if you care about getting good you need to buy them and practice on them. Your wallet does impact your ability to improve in this game, and the game cost 70 dollar to start with. 

Avoid this game for now. The devs doesn't respect you or your time."
TEKKEN 8,1778820,176125410,"Took away Stages from the season\ultimate pass.
So if you bought the game at launch your getting even less now. I've never seen a fighting game take away stuff. Stages are always included with Season passes.  I won't be buying anything further for this game and I regret supporting it at launch now.

Game is also still buggy and punishes you for having a Fast computer now if you connect to anyone with a slow machine. So even if you want to play it reduces your graphics settings to blurry mode even if you have  a very fast machine.

Do not buy."
TEKKEN 8,1778820,176167704,"I've bought the ultimate edition that is suppose to include season pass. But if u wanna a battle pass pay more. New ouitfits? Pay. Even a new MAP is NOT in the season pass. PAY
Also balance in this game does not exist at all. Forget about it. 
Almost impossible to find a match. 10-60 mins to find winquiter and wait more. BO3 system just fuck ur ass by infinitive searching an opponent.
Tekken 8 could be the best fighting game ever exist but developers don't want to create a game but ur money.
Bandai Namco. The company full of pathetic jews that's it."
TEKKEN 8,1778820,176364038,"Probably the easiest and most aggressive entry in the series, Tekken 8 has solid features but is marred by scummy monetization policies. It feels like I'm playing a free-to-play, gacha game anytime there is a new update. Miss the latest DLC character? The main menu will remind you constantly of their presence, with the in-game store taking priority over the ""real"" menu, forcing you to navigate around it. This is unfortunate in a cheaper game, but understandable. It's unforgivable when the base cost is 70 USD, and another 40 for a ""character pass"" that includes 4 characters and nothing else. 

More concerning is the way Bandai Namco handled this. The Tekken Team has always said one thing and done another regarding these policies. Murray and Harada were on record saying there would be no in-game store, battle pass, or loot boxes. But without fail, all of these things have come to pass. The only caveat is potentially the loot boxes -- the asset is currently being used to advertise bundled costume packages -- but give it time. Recently, Heihachi's stage was sold separately from his DLC -- a departure from Tekken 7's season pass, and the community has been up-in-arms over this. But I feel the Heihachi stage drama is  just a figurehead for a larger discontent that the community feels over constantly being asked to pay more and more for things that used to be free. 

The game needs a change in direction ala No Man's Sky at this point to right the ship. There's too much negativity surrounding it, and Bandai Namco need to re-establish good will with their players. That's the only apology worth anything."
TEKKEN 8,1778820,176248283,Great Dress-up simulator with a crazy story mode and a fighting game attached
TEKKEN 8,1778820,175916972,The game looks so good it almost makes you forget the gameplay's designed for toddlers that eat glue and crayons
TEKKEN 8,1778820,176370921,"Bought the deluxe edition, and even another copy for someone else. Deluxe doesn't even come with maps. Worst purchase ever. Bandai Namco is just greedy. Terrible battle passes, and I still don't forgive them for charging for frame data in Tekken 7.
I play this game like crazy, but I will not be purchasing any more bundles, deluxe editions, or battle passes. I hope people keep pestering Katsuhiro Harada at events, because he has no soul. Buff Kazuya ""friend""."
TEKKEN 8,1778820,176376319,"This game is the first time I played Tekken feeling like I am playing a party game or a glue-sniffing 2d fighter. The fun in this game isn't earned with hard work, progression or anything. The game has many problems from launch and my friends kept saying ""They will fix it all in a year just like they did with Tekken7"". I don't think this game will last next year and it is not worth your long term investment. This game made me so disappointed i wrote a review for the first time."
TEKKEN 8,1778820,176139459,"As a long-time player of the Tekken series, I had high hopes for Tekken 8. This game is a very well designed game with an awesome story-mode, practice-mode, fighting lounge, replay features, quality of life gameplay changes and the list goes on.

The most frustrating aspect of Tekken 8 and why I decided to give this game a negative review is its aggressive monetization. Despite purchasing the Deluxe or Ultimate editions, players are still required to pay for additional content for the season which is evident with releases from the Tekken Shop, Battle Pass, and most recently paying for a stage (Heihachi) not included in the season pass. This paywall feels exploitative and detracts from the overall enjoyment of the game. It’s disappointing to see a beloved franchise prioritize micro-transactions over delivering a complete and satisfying experience.

This fighting game is still very new and so I don't mind how balanced the game feels currently despite all the criticism, because I want to give the developers more time to adjust certain things. I still enjoy T8 to a certain degree despite it not having the gameplay depth compared to older series."
TEKKEN 8,1778820,176366609,"Tekken 8 is a complete mess of 50/50 and balancing nonsense! The core Tekken skills that have been essential for almost 30 years is totally pointless and waste of time now!  Tekken 8 cranks it up a thousand times worse! It's infuriating!

- The new stage is now also greeeeeddddyy asf. Even for Ultimate Edition/Season Pass owners! idk what inside their head.

- Absolutely awful—when both the competitive and casual players agree on how bad things are, you know it's a disaster. But leadership? They either don't see the problem or just flat-out don't care about anything beyond making money. They haven't bothered to fix the balance for months, ignoring it patch after patch, and they even have the nerve to brag about it on Twitter!

- On top of that, they unleashed a wave of DMCA takedowns targeting modders, trying to shut them down and force players to rely only on the game's overpriced paid items. And surprise, surprise, it backfired! Despite the backlash, modders are still going strong, even if their work has been pushed underground and is harder to find.

I love Tekken since when i was kid, but whatever this “product” is turning into? It’s a complete disaster."
TEKKEN 8,1778820,176290177,"If you're on the fence I would not buy this product. The game itself is good but the Bandai Namco is out of touch and puts a battle pass on a full price game. The deluxe and ultimate edition is NOT worth it unless you want to pay like $8 for some gold skins and get the new characters a few days early. Certain stages are pay walled and is not even included in either deluxe or ultimate edition. DLC characters can not be labbed or replayed if you do not own them. If you must get the game, get the base game and buy any DLC characters you are interested in and do not support their bs."
TEKKEN 8,1778820,173845976,"The most degenerate modern fighting game on the market, even more so than Guilty Gear Strive. Press buttons when you're minus in defence, apply the most stupid pressure when you're in offence and never start blocking, that is very punishable in this game"

Dofus,254300,49335213,"I've been waiting for this to be on steam for so long (A) it may look like a cartoonish game for small kids but it isn't the case at all. I like the graphics style even cause it is so different from any other game.

And the tactics / strategy in this game is on another level ++ 

I've had breaks from time to time cause of the subscription but it is way lower then most games so defentely a recommend for anyone who likes turn based open world games with a big comedy factor and lore behind it"
